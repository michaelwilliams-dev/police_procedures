to mailroom managers in federal correctional facilities to evenly enforce bans while less authority is centralized among individual staffers. The review committee would similarly oversee an appeals process for restricted materials through which prisoners can file for a reversal of a ban that restricted their access to a title. Policy Analysis Centralized lists of banned books promote proper standards of consistency and accountability across the many facilities within the federal prison system while safeguarding the security interests that motivate bans. The current BOP policy explicitly prohibits creating a central list of bans which may have resulted from arguments that lists indirectly promote increased censorship as books would not be re-reviewed each time they are received.8 This approach, however, ignores the importance of transparency in the censorship that already occurs. Inconsistent applications of bans across facilities make tracking book bans more complex, and the inmatesâ experiences vary. Mailroom staffers responsible for designating books as permissible or restricted are included in the correctional industryâs high turnover rates in which 63% of staffers leave the prison correctional field in less than 2 years.6 This turnover presents problems for consistency in book bans not only across facilities but over time as well. Implementing a centralized banned titles list would standardize the enforcement of the practice within federal facilities irrespective of staff changes. Such legislation would be an incremental and alternative approach compared to previously introduced policies targeting access to literature in prisons, including the Prison Libraries Act of 2023, which sought to strengthen relationships between prisons and library services through grant programs.9 Working toward a more transparent book-banning process would provide a foundation for future collaborations with libraries and nonprofits and expand prisonersâ opportunities to read without the same costs for implementation associated with similar proposals. Highlights Only 28 states keep official records of the book titles banned in their prisons, and only 15 provide the reasoning for restriction.6 The inconsistency in book banning and the absence of sufficient documentation of the practice obscures the literary censorship experienced by inmates and warrants policy intervention. The Federal Bureau of Prisons should publish and maintain centralized lists of banned books to promote consistency and accountability across the many facilities within the federal prison system while safeguarding the security interests that motivate bans. Such legislation would be an alternative approach to previously introduced policies targeting access to literature in prisons but without the same costs for implementation, including the Prison Libraries Act of 2023, which sought to strengthen relationships between prisons and library services through grant programs.9 Implementation Congress should mandate the BOP to centralize book ban lists in the federal prison system.10 While Congress can present numerous challenges, reforming the federal prison system is currently on the national agenda, and policymakers have demonstrated their willingness to support change. In July of 2024, President Joe Biden signed the Federal Prison Oversight Act, which mandates independent oversight of the BOP through facility inspections, complaints, and inquiry systems and prohibits BOP resistance to any investigative efforts.11 The Federal Prison
