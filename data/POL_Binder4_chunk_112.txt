13% of total gas consumption in the United States.4 This consumption, in turn, leads to a lack of vertical equity in gas purchasing. Rural âsuperusersâ â many of whom earn below the national median incomeâ are spending roughly a quarter of their income on gas alone.4 In rural America, where incomes are often below the national median, electric vehicles save families upwards of $1,900 to $2,800 a year.5 The United States has been relatively aggressive under the Biden Administration in transitioning towards a decarbonized transportation sector. The Inflation Reduction Act allotted hundreds of millions of dollars towards electric vehicle initiatives, and earlier this year, the Biden Administration announced grants upwards of $623 million to construct new electric vehicle charging stations.6 This is progressive but does not sustain charging in extremely sparsely populated communities. The public investment from federal dollars has so far not spread deep into rural America though it has still only been three years since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Rural drivers have a 40% lower adoption rate of electric vehicles than non-rural counterparts, and this divide continues to grow.7 Policy Idea Using the Essential Air Service program as a template, the United States Federal Government should expand upon the initial spending of the Biden Administration and fully subsidize the construction and long-term usage of electric vehicle chargers in rural areas more than 20 miles from a public electric vehicle charger. The program will primarily involve implementing charging stations in areas currently not served or near chargers, and the funding will continue to subsidize chargers in areas that are not commercially viable in the long term. Similar to the Essential Air Service, states should condition continued deployment of charging on minimum usage thresholds that can vary depending on distance from the next closest existing, non- subsidized charging station. Policy Analysis The success of charging stations in rural America is built around the greater adoption of electric vehicles and a sustained reduction in carbon emissions from motor vehicles more broadly. Access to an electric vehicle charger is the greatest factor in an individualâs decision to switch from gasoline cars; according to the Pew Research Center, 49% of those who live within a mile of an electric vehicle charging station support switching their car to electric.3 The greater density of chargers in rural America potentially tackles the extremely pressing range issue that EVs face: drivers are hesitant to use electric vehicles for long drives out of fear that there will be long gaps without access to chargers. A Harvard Business study found that the largest concern over electric vehicles among drivers today is the insatiable pricing at charging stations driven by the inconsistent supply of electricity and charging infrastructure.8 This program will have lasting economic benefits for rural drivers. Switching to electric vehicles is estimated to save rural drivers, who drive the most, upwards of $4,000 a year in gasoline costs.9 The return on investment for the subsidies will likely take time as demand for electric vehicles grows
