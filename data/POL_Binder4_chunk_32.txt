report key information about each stop, including the reason the driver was pulled over. Policy Analysis A ban on checkpoints would reduce racial discrepancies in policing by eliminating a policing method that often targets Latino and Black communities.7,8 Based on the research of several cities in California, checkpoints are often placed outside of Latino communities, leading to disproportionate arrests of Latinos and over-policing of Latino communities.7 Research in Chicago showed that checkpoints similarly target Black and Latino communities, resulting in nearly 20 unrelated citations per drunk driver arrested.8 Banning checkpoints would decrease disproportionate policing of Black and Latino neighborhoods, encouraging other police methods that do not over police Black and Latino communities. While checkpoint stops may produce some social benefits, it is important to consider the costs incurred. These stops are effective at decreasing alcohol-related crashes, but they are extremely costly.2 Typical checkpoints use 15 or more officers and cost between $5,000 and $7,000.2 Instead, police can use alternative methods with similarly effective reduction in driving under the influence.6 Although evidence for the effectiveness of saturation patrols in reducing alcohol-impaired driving is less established than for checkpoints, saturation patrols are frequently used by state patrols and local police departments along with other strategies.9 Combined, these methods are associated with a reduction in alcohol-impaired driving while operating at a lower cost.9 The main costs of saturation patrols are time and publicity, such as billboards and advertisements that promote awareness of the patrol, which are flexible in price depending on the resources of the department implementing them.6 Prior research on checkpoint stops has also cited saturation patrols as a similar yet more sensible alternative, lending an ethos to saturation patrols of inspiring public trust.10 Highlights Checkpoint stops raise concerns of racial profiling and privacy violations, shown by research into California and North Carolina cities showing disproportionate placement of checkpoints outside of Latino communities.4,7 Running checkpoint stops requires a lot of police resources that could instead be used for other tested anti- impaired driving methods that would more fairly protect communities.2,6 Placing a ban on checkpoint stops and utilizing saturation patrols and related measures would protect Fourth Amendment rights, ensuring stops are based on a specific cause and reducing racial disparities in traffic stops. Implementation To ban checkpoints in the state of New York, the New York legislature would introduce a bill to ban checkpoint stops. Under this policy, sheriff departments would be required to have a specific cause to make a stop and The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services would train officers to document key information about the stop, such as why the driver was pulled over. These measures protect privacy and increase transparency in law enforcement practices. Upon transitioning away from checkpoint stops, the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services would instruct sheriffs on implementing saturation patrols and other methods and reassigning officers from checkpoints.11 Redirecting funds from checkpoints would allow flexibility in spending on traffic enforcement and areas with different needs to implement less costly
