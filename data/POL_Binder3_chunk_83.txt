of data collection involved obtaining the details of those who were associated with the top ten residential addresses. [Table I. Property categories] Analysis Descriptive results were calculated and analysed using total counts (n), percentages and appropriate measures of central tendency. Firstly, the top ten consumers within each of the five categories (see Table I) were examined in terms of; (i) incident classifications (see Table II), (ii) the time frames these are occurring, and (iii) the response codes that were allocated to these incidents (see Table III). [Table II. Incident classifications and descriptions] [Table III. Response code grades and descriptions] Lastly, a content analysis was conducted on residential household and family characteristics. The profiling of residential addresses considered their local profiles to obtain key characteristics and warning markers. Individual incident logs were also examined to gain an understanding about the reasons why there was such demand from each address during the year. Results / Findings The top ten statutory bodies have the most incidents calling for police service (30%) compared with the top ten in the other address categories. This is followed by those in the retail category (24%) and nightlife (18%), with young peopleÕs services and residential requiring the least resources (14% of the total each). Incident Classification The majority of all reported incidents fell under the classification of ÔotherÕ (n = 1136, 28.35%) (see Table IV). For the coded classifications, the biggest demand was from welfare (n = 756, 18.87%), nuisance (n = 734, 18.32%), and acquisitive person crime (n = 667, 16.65%). [Table IV. Incident classification for all categories profiled] Most of the top ten residential addresses were found to associate with one specific incident classification. When exploring the residential demand (see Table V), welfare incidents accounted for the highest number of the reported incidents (n = 210, 37.91%). However, this was skewed by four addresses that accounted for 89.5% of the incidents. This suggests that welfare is a distinct problem area for some particular households, but that nuisance is causing problems across a wider amount of addresses. [Table V. Incident classification for individual address categories] Incidents classified as ÔotherÕ were found to be the biggest call for services in statutory bodies (n = 565, 47.28%), and the largest coded incident classifications were welfare (n = 245, 20.5%) and nuisance (n = 178, 14.9%) (see Table V). However, this is skewed by the inclusion of a central hospital which generated a large number of welfare incidents. If this address is removed, statutory bodies accrue a larger amount nuisance incidents (n = 104, 20.47%) and ÔotherÕ incidents (n = 234, 46.06%). Despite this, welfare is still the third highest demand intensive classification accounting for 11.61% of the incidents (n = 59). For the top ten retail addresses, the most demand is focused on the acquisitive personal crime (n = 475, 49.63%). Again, ÔotherÕ (n = 192) and nuisance (n = 166) incidents were also highly demanding for retail addresses accounting for 20.06% and 17.35% respectively. Within the top ten
