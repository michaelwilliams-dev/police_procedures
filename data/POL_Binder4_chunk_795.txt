A byelaw may be included in the list of byelaws published for the purposes of this paragraph only if the chief officer of police and the relevant body which made the byelaw agree that it should be included. The chief officer of police for the relevant police area must publish the list in such a way as to bring it to the attention of members of the public in localities where the byelaws in the list apply.

In the case of a relevant offence that is an offence under a listed byelaw (see sub-paragraphs (3)(e) and (5)), the power to impose a requirement under sub- paragraph (1) is exercisable only in a place to which the byelaw relates. In its application in relation to an offence in respect of which the CSO or CSV is authorised to give a penalty notice under section 444A of the Education Act 1996 (penalty notice in respect of failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil), sub-paragraph (1)(a) of this paragraph has effect as if the words âin the relevant police areaâ were omitted.
