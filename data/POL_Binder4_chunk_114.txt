the policy too, as it might induce non-car owners to purchase an EV as their first car. A bipartisan group of senators, akin to the legislative process for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, could be highly effective at working out a comprehensive framework that appeals to conservatives invested in climate solutions. The implementation of the policy can follow the existing legislation signed into law by President Biden subsidizing EVs (the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law), but this new legislation will have to be more spatially targeted. The legislation will have to target communities of concern, namely those that are not located near any existing charging stations, and the legislation language will have to be strict that funds are conditional on being spent in said communities.

Building Resilience through a Climate Change Superfund By Connor Weiss, cjw273@cornell.edu New Jersey is warming faster than any other state in the Northeast United States. It is time for the New Jersey State Legislature to pass a climate change superfund law to hold corporations accountable for climate change. Background While most states around the US have seen increases in temperature around 2.5ÂºF since 1970, New Jersey
