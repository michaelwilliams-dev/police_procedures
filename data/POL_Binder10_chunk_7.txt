Law Enforcement Purposes are defined as: prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. Where police officers or Wiltshire Police/OPCC staff abuse their position and view confidential information without a legitimate Law Enforcement Purpose, this serves not only to undermine the trust of the public, but could also be a breach of the Data Protection Act 2018, the Computer Misuse Act 1990, the Code of Ethics, Standards of Professional Behaviour, and Force Policy. 3. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Personnel are able to use the Wiltshire Police/OPCC IT and telephony systems for Wiltshire Police and OPCC business use and appropriate personal use as described throughout this document. The general principles are that users must:  Use the facility in a responsible manner by adhering to the Code of Ethics, the Standards of Professional Behaviour;  Comply with all existing Information Systems and Information Security policies;  Ensure they are aware of their personal responsibilities;  Not access unsuitable material;  Not use the systems for non-work related issues during working time, except during refreshment or other authorised breaks.
