associated with a reduction of the symptoms of burnout.8 A lack of administrative support is one of the most common reasons that SETs consider or ultimately decide to leave special education.8 Insufficient support can include limited access to teaching materials and resources as well as inadequate assistance from central and building office personnel.10 A study of 391 SETs found that those reporting higher levels of principal support were more likely to demonstrate greater commitment and job satisfaction.8 By allocating additional funds and dedicated personnel to support SETs, schools could alleviate much of the pressure and stress that SETs face, leading to increased job satisfaction and job retention. Highlights  The growing number of students benefiting from specialized and tailored education programs has led to a significant shortage of special education teachers.3  Low job retention rates, rising job dissatisfaction, and heightened levels of burnout contribute to the shortage of special education teachers.  Congress should enhance the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to help teachers manage burnout and increase administrative support.  These programs should use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy because it alleviates burnout symptoms in other professions.8 Teachers who feel strong administrative support are more likely to report job satisfaction.8 Implementation To effectively address the special education teacher shortage, this proposal leverages IDEAÕs discretionary grants to fund ACT training and enhanced administrative support. States must apply for these grants by demonstrating how their proposed programs align with the objectives of IDEA while simultaneously addressing the local needs of the individual state. Each state should submit a comprehensive application to the US Department of Education detailing how they intend to use the discretionary grant funds to improve SET retention and job satisfaction and reduce burnout.11 Each application will include a comprehensive needs assessment that identifies and elaborates on local challenges, such as teacher-to- student ratios, retention trends, and existing resource deficiencies. The plan will also include ACT training and improvements to administrative support. States can develop a budget breakdown demonstrating efficient and targeted use of grant funds by employing structured budget templates, conducting thorough research and development to justify expenditures, and aligning the budget closely with the Grant Narrative.12 This approach ensures that every dollar is accounted for, supports the proposed objectives, and addresses the specific needs highlighted in the application. By integrating clear, measurable goals into the financial plan, states can present a compelling case for how funds will directly benefit their constituents and achieve the desired outcomes.12 After administering discretionary grant plans for specific states, policymakers can tailor ACT programs to align with the needs of SETs. ACT training should emphasize mindfulness, value-driven action, and psychological flexibility to alleviate burnout in high-stress professions. This training can occur through professional development days, online platforms, or weekend workshops for SETs.13 In addition to a portion of the fund allocated directly to ACT programming, another portion should be allocated for an increase in administrative support, such as hiring instructional aides and support staff to assist SETs with non-teaching tasks and increasing
