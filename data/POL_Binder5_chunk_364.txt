Introduction 1.1. Background The Home Office have specified test standards for body armour intended for UK law enforcement for over two decades. These standards detail test methods and minimum performance requirements for body armour to provide levels of knife, spike and ballistic protection, primarily to the torso region. The first Home Office Body Armour Standard was written in 1993 and there have been three subsequent iterations published in 1999, 2003 and 2007. In each standard, a number of changes have been made in order to develop tests that are more consistent, practical, and representative of current operational threats to UK law enforcement. Notable features of each of these standards have been summarised: 1993 The first standard published by the Home Office, addressing knife threats for body armour. Revised in 1995 to cover ballistic threats. 1999 Major revision to the 1993 standard including the introduction of a guided-mass knife drop test; composite knife test backing material; non-edged spike testing; and, tiered protection levels to address a range of severities of knife, spike and ballistic threat. 2003 Introduction of a HG1/A ballistic protection level with additional permissible back face signature (BFS) to hand gun threats. 2007 Major revision of the 2003 standard including increased protection levels to address more powerful hand gun (HG3) and rifle (RF2) weaponry; in-production manufacturers quality testing (MQT); and increased number of knife, spike and ballistic compliance tests. The Home Office Body Armour Standard (2017) supersedes all previous Home Office Body Armour standards. Any certification to previous standards remains extant provided the manufacturer, where applicable, complies with the requirements of MQT within the respective standard. 1.2. Rationale Since the 2007 standard, the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST) has engaged with a range of stakeholders to establish a set of operational requirements for the Home Office Body Armour Standard (2017). These included the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), the Police Federation, end-users, manufacturers of body armour, test facilities and technical experts. These requirements provided direction for a body of work to produce a test standard that better represented the needs of end-users. The key requirement for
