Information security is the preservation of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information: a. Confidentiality - Protecting sensitive or personal information from unauthorised disclosure, both to outsiders, and to staff who have no requirement to access such information in the course of their duties; b. Integrity - Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and information processing methods; c. Availability - Ensuring that information and associated services are available to meet the needs of the Force. Information security is required during the entire lifecycle of a piece of information, from the moment it is collected or created, throughout its usage, through to ultimate disposal. Appropriate measures need to be applied to ensure that information security is maintained. Information security promotes trust and confidence in the ForceÕs services, practices and IT infrastructure and systems. The achievement of information security needs a combination of policies, standards, procedures, guidelines, appropriate organisational structure, physical security considerations, and measures to safeguard the ICT network infrastructure and information systems. This policy contains a summary of the expectations from all users of the ForceÕs systems and applications. Where relevant, links to more detailed guidance will
