Breaking the Cycle: Strengthening Police Response to Domestic Violence in Kyrgyzstan By Olivia Pham, omp24@cornell.edu The Kyrgyz government should implement mandatory, specialized police training to enhance law enforcementâs effectiveness in protecting domestic violence victims, increasing reporting rates, and building trust to ensure justice is served. Background Kyrgyzstan ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1997, committing to uphold womenâs rights and combat discrimination.1 However, the country has struggled to meet these obligations, particularly in addressing domestic violence.2,3 Police often focus on reconciliation rather than victim protection, and families commonly pressure victims to reconcile instead of pursuing legal action. 4,5,6 This lack of enforcement leaves victims vulnerable and without proper legal recourse. In rural areas, cultural stigma and a strong emphasis on family unity deter women from approaching law enforcement, which limits forensic evidence collection and prevents many cases from reaching court.7 Sexual violence crimes are often only prosecuted when physical injuries or biological evidence are present, reflecting a narrow interpretation of âviolenceâ in Kyrgyz law that excludes psychological or economic harm.8 Consequently, many forms of abuse remain unaddressed. Moreover, the legal term âhelplessnessâ in cases of sexual assault lacks a clear definition, leaving victims without legal recourse if they cannot physically resist. Approximately 86% of domestic violence cases are retracted, often due to police inaction, financial dependency, and a lack of shelterâfactors that leave victims with few options but to return to unsafe situations.9 Alarmingly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported a 20% increase in domestic violence cases in 2023 compared to the previous year, while the number of domestic violence victims increased by 5.1 times from 2010 to 2021.10,11 Women in rural areas are most affected due to the legal and cultural barriers. Children also suffer under this system, with 104 cases of child violence documented in 2021, many of which were prematurely closed.12 Current policies, such as the Law on Domestic Violence, still have weak law enforcement that fails to provide adequate protection through restraining orders and prioritizes reconciliation.13 Policy Idea
