of children. Understanding the emotional and psychological impact of domestic abuse is extremely challenging, and social workers will draw on a wide range of skills in assessing and responding effectively. The JTAI also highlighted the need to: develop age-appropriate tools to understand the range of risks that children face; adopt a systematic focus on the perpetratorâs behaviour rather than just focusing on the victim as the sole solution; and help schools support victims and families, particularly given the protective role education can play when the impact of domestic abuse is fully understood and taken into account. It is important for social workers to work in partnership with children, families and professionals, being both authoritative and empathic and recognising the shame, fear Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance and resistance that can surround domestic abuse. In doing so, they can draw on the key features of effective practice, including using a strengths-based and systemic approach, doing skilled direct work and reflective supervision and practice within their organisation, such as group case discussions.

The co-location of specialists can help facilitate multi-disciplinary working particularly in places where families already know and feel comfortable. There should be data-sharing within, and between, teams, including qualitative recording of familiesâ experiences of working with professionals. Separate workers for victims and perpetrators and for adults and children, operating within the same team, can be crucial to building familiesâ trust and ensuring safety.155 Box 6.2: Case Study â Whole-system approach to safeguarding children 155 Department for Education.
