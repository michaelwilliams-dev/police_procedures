The monitoring and recording of communications will be considered on a case by case basis and will be used:  to ascertain compliance with regulatory or self-regulatory practices or procedures;  for an appropriate method of ascertaining standards;  to prevent or detect crime;  to investigate or detect unauthorised use.  Wiltshire Police Counter Corruption Unit is authorised to carry out the appropriate auditing of system use.
