and/or seized. The powers therefore need to be fully and clearly justified before they are used. The use of the powers which impact upon individualsÕ rights must be proportionate to the outcome being sought. In particular, those exercising the powers must consider at every stage whether the necessary objectives can be achieved by less intrusive means Ð this may be by approaching the potential respondent to ascertain whether they will provide the required information without the need for a court order or to give them prior notice that an application is to be made. The giving of prior notice of an application may mean that a respondent is ready to comply and allows them the opportunity to make representations about the detail of the order or notice due to the nature of the investigation or what they will be required to produce.

They must also have regard to the desirability of promoting good relations between persons of different religious belief, political opinion or racial group. 19. The appropriate officer (in the case of an application for a warrant) or appropriate person (in the case of execution of a warrant) should also consider whether this consultation could jeopardize an ongoing (sensitive) wider operation or investigation. In such circumstances consultation may not be advisable. 20. The expectation is that the provisions of the Code will apply to all searches carried out under this Code. 21.
