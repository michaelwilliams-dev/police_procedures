date of manufacture, the type of cartridge it was designed to use, and by reference to its propulsion system. These descriptions are specified in the Antique Firearms Regulations 2021 (Òthe 2021 RegulationsÓ). The statutory definition 8.2 The requirement for an antique firearm to be sold, transferred, purchased, acquired or possessed as a curiosity or ornament, in order for the exemption in section 58(2) of the 1968 Act to apply, is unchanged and continues to apply in all cases. 8.3 Under section 58(2), an Òantique firearmÓ is a firearm that meets the following conditions: a) either its propulsion system is of a specified type (see paragraph 8.4 and section 58(2C) of the 1968 Act) or the chamber or chambers are those that the firearm had when it was manufactured (or is a replacement that is identical in all material respects) and the firearm is chambered for use with a specified cartridge (see paragraph 8.5 and section 58(2B) of the 1968 Act); and b) it was manufactured before a specified date (see paragraph 8.8 and section 58(2D)(b)). Propulsion systems 8.4 A firearm can be regarded as an antique if its propulsion system is of a specified description (see section 58(2C) of the 1968 Act). Regulation 3 of the 2021 Regulations specifies the following types of propulsion system: a) any propulsion system which involves the use of a loose charge and a separate ball (or other missile) loaded at the muzzle end of the barrel, chamber or cylinder of the firearm and which uses an independent source of ignition. This covers muzzle-loading firearms; b) any propulsion system in a breech-loading cartridge firearm which uses an ignition system other than rim-fire or centre-fire. For example, this would include pin-fire and needle-fire ignition systems, as well as lip fire, cup- primed, teat fire and base fire systems; 58 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law c) any propulsion system which involves the use of rim-fire cartridges (other than .22 (5.58 mm), .23 (5.8 mm), 6mm or 9mm rim-fire cartridges) in a breech-loading firearm; or d) any propulsion system for an air weapon (England and Wales only). This does not include prohibited air weapons or air weapons of a type declared specially dangerous. Obsolete cartridges 8.5 Under section 58(2B) of the 1968 Act, a firearm can also be regarded as an antique if: a) its chamber (or each of its chambers, if it has more than one) is either a chamber it had when it was manufactured or it is a replacement for such a chamber that is identical to it in all material respects; and b) its chamber (or each of its chambers) is designed for use with a specified type of cartridge, whether or not it is also capable of being used with other cartridges. Regulation 2 and the Schedule to the 2021 Regulations specify those cartridges. 8.6 The Antique Firearms (Amendment) Regulations 2021 come into effect on 28 December 2021 and will correct an omission from the 2021 Regulations by adding to paragraph 5 of
