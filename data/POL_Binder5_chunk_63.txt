Thus a fully automatic weapon such as a Bren gun which has been smooth-bored and adapted to single-shot would still be classified as a prohibited weapon, as would a pistol that had a 24 inch or more smoothbore barrel fitted to it. 2.63 Section 7(1)(b) provides an exception in respect of self-loading or pump-action smooth-bore guns which have at some time possessed a barrel under 24 inches (and would otherwise be caught under section 5(1)(ac) of the 1968 Act) and which at the present time have a barrel of 24 inches or more. This takes account of the fact that some self-loading and pump-action smooth-bore guns are 18 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law manufactured so as to readily accommodate, and with equal facility, interchangeable barrels of varying lengths, which may be more or less than 24 inches. The exception therefore protects a person who acquires such a gun in its long-barrelled mode without being aware that in the past it had been fitted with a shorter barrel. 2.64 Section 7(2) of the 1988 Act provides that a weapon which: a) has at any time since the coming into force of section 2 of the 1988 Act (which required a firearm certificate for certain types of shot gun) been a weapon to which
