optimizing policing responses to aging populations, advocating for sustainable, age-friendly policing practices. Research limitations/implications The reviewÕs limitations stem from primarily English-language studies, potentially overlooking non-English literature. Variability in study designs and outcomes poses challenges to synthesizing findings comprehensively. Limited generalizability may result due to geographic and cultural differences in policing practices. Future research could benefit from longitudinal studies assessing long-term impacts and broader inclusion of diverse policing contexts and perspectives, enhancing applicability and depth of understanding in optimizing police interactions with older adults. Practical implications Practical implications include informing policy makers and law enforcement agencies about effective strategies to enhance interactions with older adults, emphasizing communication skills and de-escalation techniques. Training programs should integrate age-sensitive approaches to improve officersÕ awareness and response to older adultsÕ needs and vulnerabilities. Implementing community engagement initiatives can foster trust and cooperation, contributing to safer and more supportive environments for older adults in policing interactions. These efforts can ultimately promote enhanced well-being and reduced conflicts between law enforcement and older adults. Social implications Social implications highlight the need for broader societal awareness and education regarding the challenges faced by older adults in interactions with law enforcement. Addressing ageism and promoting respectful treatment can enhance community trust and reduce misunderstandings. Improved interactions between older adults and law enforcement can foster a more inclusive and supportive society, ensuring that older adults feel valued and protected. This can contribute to overall social cohesion and a more equitable experience for older adults in their interactions with law enforcement agencies. Originality/value The originality of this study lies in its focus on the intersection of age-related issues and law enforcement interactions, a relatively underexplored area in both gerontology and criminal justice research. By examining the perceptions and experiences of older adults and law enforcement officers, it provides valuable insights into mitigating ageism and improving interactions. The studyÕs findings contribute to enhancing understanding of how to promote respectful and effective communication between these groups, thereby offering practical implications for policy and training initiatives aimed at fostering better relationships and outcomes for older adults in law enforcement encounters.
