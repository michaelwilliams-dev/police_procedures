commonly referred to in the context of plates. Strike face The surface of the body armour designated by the manufacturer to face the threat (the side oriented away from the body). Technical file Comprehensive document containing technical details pertaining to armour submitted for certification. Test series A set of fair strikes on a given protective panel. Unfair strike An impact that does not adhere to the specified minimum acceptable criteria in terms of strike placement or velocity. Unformed armour Flat panels of body armour. VTEST Maximum velocity specified within a protection level (e.g. HO1: 365 Â± 10 m.s-1, VTEST: 375 m.s-1) V01 The velocity of bullet, for given armour, at which 1% of shots are predicted to perforate and 99% are predicted to be held. V50 The velocity of bullet, for given armour, at which 50% of shots are predicted to perforate and 50% are predicted to be held. Wet testing Testing of body armour after pre-conditioning submerged in water. Yaw The angular deviation of a projectile about its longitudinal axis.
