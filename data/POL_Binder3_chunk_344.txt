financial literacy among students, and could help mitigate costs with funding and curriculum planning support.17 However, even without these measures, no changes to the education budget would be necessary due to the policyÕs low price, as there are minimal costs associated with curriculum design and a short training session.18 Additionally, concerns over another graduation requirement may be calmed by the widespread support for the course.19 In conclusion, despite possible implementation challenges, a financial literacy course in NYS high schools is feasible and would be extremely helpful for students. It is imperative to equip students with essential skills to confidently manage their financial futures, setting them on a path toward long- term stability and success. Works Cited [1] Investopedia.
