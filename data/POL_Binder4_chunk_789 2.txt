[ Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply where the person in charge of the investigation F983(1A) is the Director General acting personally, but the Director General must complete a report on the investigation.] The [F973Director General]â must send a copy of [F984a report submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or completed under sub-paragraph (1A)] to the whistle-blower, and may, with the consent of the whistle-blower, send a copy of the report to the appropriate authority. The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for circumstances in which the duty under sub-paragraph (2)(a) does not apply. The power conferred by sub-paragraph (3) may be exercised only to the extent that the Secretary of State considers necessary for any of the permitted non-disclosure purposes. The Secretary of State may also by regulations make provision for circumstances in which (despite sub-paragraph (2)(b)) a copy of the report may be sent to the appropriate authority without the consent of the whistle-blower. The power conferred by sub-paragraph (5) may be exercised only to the extent that the Secretary of State considers necessary for any of the permitted disclosure purposes. Where the [F973Director General] would contravene section 21A by sending a copy of a report in its entirety to the whistle-blower or to the appropriate authority, the [F973Director General] may comply with its duty under sub-paragraph (2)(a) or (as the case may be) may exercise its power under sub-paragraph (2)(b) (or under regulations under sub-paragraph (5)) by sending instead a copy of the report after having removed or obscured the information which it is prohibited from disclosing by section 21A. In this paragraphâ âthe permitted non-disclosure purposesâ has the same meaning as in section 29I; 254 Police Reform
