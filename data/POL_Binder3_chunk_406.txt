provider. Automated kiosks can be applied to various public health initiatives, such as screenings for HIV, to provide more equitable access to minority populations.12 At-home stool-based tests serve as viable substitutes to conventional screening methods in both their efficacy and distribution. The FIT kit is a unique method of screening that tests for occult blood in the stool with an overall 95% accuracy.13 Pilot trials conducted by the National Cancer Institute have shown improved completion of CRC screenings by distributing FIT kits through a mailing process, finding higher and quicker response rates with FIT kit outreach compared to colonoscopy distribution.14 Other private or state- level initiatives present a pragmatic approach to distributing low-cost testing kits, including FIT implementation guides that demonstrate the feasibility of their use and return.15,16 In addition, the FIT kit is a noninvasive alternative to colonoscopies that is currently underutilized among all populations.17 The community outreach program associated with the screenings will help ensure that the distribution methods are culturally competent, inclusive, and accessible to minority populations. A study that implemented a culturally tailored navigator intervention program found increased screening rates led by multilingual navigators that educated patients on CRC, addressed barriers to screening, translated information, and organized appointments.18 Using a hands-on approach to understand the perceptions and accommodate for the individual circumstances of participating community residents can enhance overall screening outcomes.19 Highlights  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths; however, the rates of diagnoses and mortalities are substantially amplified for minority populations.1,2  CRC is one of the most preventable cancers through adequate early screenings.4 However, typical screening methods, such as colonoscopies, are invasive and lower quality for minority individuals and lead to reduced screening participation among these groups.5,6  To address disparities in CRC treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÕs Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) should administer self-service kiosks in high- traffic areas for minority populations that distribute culturally tailored Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) kits.  Establishing self-service kiosks that distribute FIT kits should be feasible and convenient based on prior implementation of screening kiosks for other diseases and the employment of past FIT kit initiatives; the introduction of community outreach programs should help ensure accessibility for minority populations.10,14,15,16,18,19 Implementation Congress should enact the CRCCPÕs proposed policy for self- service kiosks. With the CRCCPÕs mobilized support from Congress and current funding to Ò20 states, 8 universities, 2 tribal organizations, and 5 other organizations,Ó the CRCCP already serves a substantial portion of the general public and diversifies its support coalition.20 Furthermore, its partnerships with various healthcare organizations allow the CRCCP to improve CRC screening strategies and promote the federal administration of self- service kiosks.20 These pre-existing support networks can be pivotal in promoting the policy through federal avenues. The policy can receive added assistance from the American Cancer Society National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, an organization that supports policy action in key issues surrounding CRC by increasing public awareness and sharing implementation strategies from healthcare organizations.21 Additionally, congressional support for federal
