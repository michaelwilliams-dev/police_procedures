Data for Indonesia refer to girls aged 0 to 11 years since prevalence data on FGM among girls and women aged 15 to 49 years is not available.

Prevalence of FGM in England and Wales The prevalence of FGM in England and Wales is difficult to estimate because of the hidden nature of the crime. However, a 2015 study12 estimated that:  approximately 60,000 girls aged 0-14 were born in England and Wales to mothers who had undergone FGM (see Annex B for risk factors); and  approximately 103,000 women aged 15-49 and approximately 24,000 women aged 50 and over who have migrated to England and Wales are living with the consequences of FGM. In addition, approximately 10,000 girls aged under 15 who have migrated to England and Wales are likely to have undergone FGM. 2.4.1 Prevalence of FGM at a Local Level Local data should be used to understand the scale and needs of the population affected by FGM in a particular area. The 2015 study13 reported that no local authority area in England and Wales is likely to be free from FGM entirely. Regional breakdowns of these prevalence estimates14 show that while urban areas, and specifically London, have the highest estimated prevalence, every area is likely to be affected in some way. It should also be noted that women and girls from affected communities living in low prevalence areas may be more isolated and in greater need of targeted support. NHS Digital publishes quarterly statistics15 on the profile of patients treated within the National Health Service in England who are identified through their treatment as having had FGM16. In Wales, each health boardÕs FGM lead collates instances of FGM identified within their organisation. 12 Macfarlane A, Dorkenoo E.
