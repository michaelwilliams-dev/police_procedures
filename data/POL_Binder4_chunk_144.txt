Addressing Floridaâs Hidden Epidemic in Polypharmacy By Tanirika Choudhry, tc769@cornell.edu The Florida Department of Health should implement a Polypharmacy Reduction Initiative (FPRI) to reduce polypharmacy risks in elderly populations through pharmacist-led reviews, and deprescribing protocols. This would improve health outcomes, lower costs, and enhance quality of life statewide. Background Polypharmacy, the use of five or more medications simultaneously, is common among older adults managing multiple chronic conditions.1 While comprising only 14% of the United States population, individuals 65 years and older account for over one-third of outpatient prescription medication.2 Polypharmacy is a growing concern with negative health consequences such as increased risk of adverse drug reactions, higher hospitalization rates, healthcare costs, and lower quality of life.3 For example, in conditions like heart failure, certain medications may offer little benefit or cause harm while increasing the risks of cognitive impairment, falls, and drug-disease interactions (instances where a drug prescribed for one condition exacerbates another). 1 Inappropriate use of medications increases the risk of complications and places financial burdens on patients and caregivers. A 2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey found that polypharmacy was associated with nearly double the total healthcare costs (198%) and almost triple the pharmacy- related costs (287%) compared to patients without polypharmacy. 4 Adjusted data show patients with polypharmacy incur average annual costs of $19,068, versus $8,815 for others.4 Medicare and Medicaid shoulder much of this financial strain as polypharmacy increases the risk of medication-related problems (MRPs).
