speeding up the subsequent recovery; and o contribute to ManchesterÕs prominence as a leading economic hub by showcasing its ongoing commitment to building safe, sustainable and resilient communities by continually increasing the resilience of the city. MBCF has a number of notable features: o activities and priorities for the MBCF are always member coordinated, led and driven o o recognition of the part every organisation has to play in ensuring Manchester has ÔBusiness Continuity Whatever the DisruptionÕ o firm commitment to building on and facilitating the sharing of BCM knowledge and expertise already present in Manchester o commitment to partnership with leading professional bodies, academia and complementary networks o real opportunities for a wide range of organisations to learn from each other, share good practice and experience and opportunities to work together to increase the resilience of Manchester o willingness to share the learning and successes of MBCF outside of Manchester Ð regionally, nationally and internationally. The MBCFÕs accountability to its members is demonstrated by the existence of a Steering Group, which consists of member organisations working to terms of reference and overseeing the delivery of a formal work plan for MBCF. To help reflect the needs of the City and the ability to provide a wide range of general and specific business continuity advice and guidance, the Steering Group is made up of representatives from a variety of organisations and subject matter experts in the field of resilience. Current Steering Group representation includes senior representation from large blue chip companies, Third Sector organisations, business networks, including the Chamber of Commerce, universities, and the emergency services. Crucially, Manchester City Council has facilitated the creation of a clear and individual identity for the MBCF to ensure that it is an independent and successful initiative, rather than being identified as a city council project. The membership reflects the diversity of the organisations within the city. MBCF is dedicated to achieving tangible outcomes including regular educational and awareness seminars, mentorship programme, networking events, scenario based testing and exercise opportunities, publications and consultation activities some of which are described below: Buddy Scheme The MBCF is particularly keen to support small and medium enterprises in the city, as well as third sector organisations, by the creation of a mentorship programme.

MBCF Network group The idea behind the MBCF Network Group is to provide an informal space for MBCF members to discuss ÔBCM in actionÕ with a very practical focus to help members help each other, by sharing good practice, experience and lessons learned from BCM incidents. Events and seminars The MBCF has hosted a variety of events, including a large launch event, which helped shape the direction of the ForumÕs activities based on direct feedback. Most of the events are aimed at any member of the Forum; however ÔKeep Calm and
