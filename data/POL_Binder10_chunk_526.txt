procedures; Â• normal duties - these should be such that they may be left to go immediately and rapidly to an emergency The training of police staff to take up paid first aider roles must be agreed with the Head of Health and Safety and endorsed by their Line Manager in order to ensure the appointment meets the needs of the Force. Once agreed the person, in conjunction with their Line Manager, should complete a Training Request Form and submit it to the Learning and Development Department in order training can be arranged. The Health and Safety Manager will advise Finance to instigate first aid payments for the role as soon as Learning and Development confirm training has been successfully completed. It should be noted that due to Police Regulations the allowance is only payable to police staff members who do not have first aid training included in their job descriptions. It is the responsibility of all first aiders to ensure a Training Request Form is submitted to the Learning and Development Department six months prior to expiry of their certificate of competence. This is to ensure refresher training can be undertaken prior to expiry of their first aid certificate of competence. Police staff whose certificates are out of date will not be paid until they have re-certificated and may be requested to vacate the role dependent on their individual reasons / circumstances for being out of date. Staff should refrain from providing first aid when their certificates are out of date unless essential for life preservation to do so. Approved First Aiders who relocate to another station or whose role/circumstances change, as a result of organisational change or personal choice, cannot be guaranteed to continue as an approved first aider as these changes may not fit with the first aid needs of their work location. Approved First Aiders who find themselves in this situation should immediately contact the Health and Safety Department in order that a review of first aid provision at the locations involved can be carried out. Each situation will be looked at on an individual basis in line with First Aid Regulations and Force requirements and the outcome discussed with the person concerned. Individuals will be notified by email by the People Services Business centre if there is no longer a requirement for them to continue in their first aider role and their first aid allowance will cease. First Aiders who find themselves in this situation will be asked if they wish to be placed on the waiting list for First Aider placements at their work location. Police Staff wishing to become first aiders at a location where no vacancy exists, and who fit the necessary criteria, will be placed on a waiting list until a place becomes available. Likewise employees joining the organisation with a current first aid at work certificate cannot be guaranteed a first aider role where no vacancy exists and will be placed on a waiting list pending a vacancy.
