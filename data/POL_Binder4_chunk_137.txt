Crime (UNODC), Kyrgyzstan can lower the costs of developing and maintaining police training programs.22 These collaborations provide access to expertise, training materials, and funding that reduce the need for Kyrgyzstan to invest heavily in creating its own training infrastructure.23 Highlights Since ratifying CEDAW in 1997, Kyrgyzstan has struggled to meet its obligations, with weak enforcement of domestic violence laws leaving victims unprotected and many cases dismissed.24 Kyrgyzstan should implement a mandatory, nationwide police training program to ensure accountability and improve protection and support for domestic violence victims.25 Addressing cultural and structural barriers, particularly in rural areas, is vital to building trust and encouraging reporting through sensitive, victim- centered approaches.26 Drawing from successful international models, Kyrgyzstan should adopt scenario-based and trauma- informed training to equip law enforcement with the skills needed for effective and compassionate interventions.27 Implementation While past legislation, such as the 2017 Law on Protection and Defense Against Domestic Violence, expanded protections on paper, its enforcement has been inadequate.28 Between January 2019 and April 2021, only 14% of reported cases reached the courts, with most dismissed due to ineffective intervention.29 This policy aims to close these gaps by introducing a comprehensive framework that prioritizes victim safety over reconciliation, addressing both structural and cultural barriers. To achieve this, amendments to the 2017 Law will be introduced through the Zhogorku Kenesh (Parliament of Kyrgyzstan) by partnering with progressive legislators and advocacy groups. Leveraging committees on human rights and gender equality, the policy will be framed as a measure aligning with Kyrgyzstanâs international obligations under CEDAW, emphasizing societal stability and the importance of addressing domestic violence as a public safety issue. This strategic framing will help navigate opposition rooted in traditional norms. Moreover, sustainable funding will be secured through government allocations and international grants, with support from organizations such as the UNDP, UNODC, and Bir Duino.30 Drawing on successful international models, this policy incorporates practices like Mexicoâs CRIMJUST program, which improved officersâ skills by 28% and increased victim cooperation and trust in law enforcement.31 These approaches highlight the effectiveness of linking funding to measurable outcomes, such as higher victim reporting rates and more effective law enforcement responses. In Kyrgyzstan, where only 10% of domestic violence cases are reported due to fear of inaction, similar training programs could raise reporting rates and foster a supportive environment for survivors. 32, 33 Tailoring these strategies to Kyrgyzstanâs cultural and institutional context will help ensure practical implementation and long-term impact. The proposed training curriculum will emphasize trauma- informed, scenario-based learning, including mock interviews and real- life simulations to strengthen practical skills and empathy among officers.34 This approach has proven effective in the U.S., where a four- hour victim-support training led to a 32% increase in positive victim interactions and improved report accuracy.35 By equipping officers to handle cases sensitively, the policy seeks to reduce victim-blaming and encourage survivors to report abuse. Additionally, implementation will begin with pilot programs in urban and rural areas, allowing for iterative improvements before scaling nationwide. Beyond skill-building, the policy includes sustained
