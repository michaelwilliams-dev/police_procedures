children, and perpetrators. This includes looking holistically at an individualâs case and circumstances to identify appropriate multi-agency support. All agencies have a duty to assess whether a safeguarding response is required before referring an incident to a multi-agency partnership. Co-locating specialist domestic abuse services or providers can be an effective way of multi-agency working. For example, some local areas have Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) based in police stations and hospitals.205 Co-location can be particularly effective in supporting those who have experienced domestic abuse, where there may be a stigma around accessing services.

The Welsh Ministers have also been consulted as required under section 11(7) of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021.
