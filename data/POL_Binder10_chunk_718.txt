less favourable treatment. The purpose of this procedure is to provide line managers, staff and those in leadership roles guidance on the menopause and the types of support available The procedure aims to create an environment in which personnel can discuss topics around the menopause without fear of taboo, and ensure everyone understands what menopause is, including its different stages. The procedure aims to ensure support is provided to personnel who are impacted by the symptoms of menopause in the office, in operational settings, or working from home. It aims to educate and inform managers about the potential symptoms of menopause, and how they can support their colleagues through reasonable adjustments. It also aims to ensure that individuals going through the menopause, and suffering with menopause symptoms, feel empowered and able to ask for support and any reasonable adjustments so they can continue to be successful in their roles. Definition The menopause is the term given to the biological change whereby an individual is no longer producing eggs from the ovaries, and subsequently oestrogen and progesterone levels fall. This results in the individual no longer having a menstrual cycle and no longer being able to become pregnant. The onset of the menopause before the age of forty is rare and is called ÔPremature Ovarian InsufficiencyÕ.
