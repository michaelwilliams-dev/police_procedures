police work were found to occur the least in this sample. This suggests that reducing demand and addressing key issues requires increased involvement with other agencies to enable the most appropriate and effective response regarding calls for service. This multi-agency early response could also free resources and reduce overall costs. Furthering the results of this study, Lancashire Constabulary are currently engaged in a large funded project around transforming Public Services within Lancashire by engaging with a range of public services who will collectively provide the most appropriate support, at the earliest point possible in that individuals life. Early identification and appropriate use of interventions are key to reduce the likelihood of individuals escalating to crisis point. References Bichler, G., Schmerler, K. and Enriquez, J.
