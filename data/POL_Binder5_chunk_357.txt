concern about the behaviour of someone working in policing that they believe has fallen below expectations do not tolerate discrimination, victimisation or any disadvantageous treatment against anyone who makes a report of unprofessional behaviour or wrongdoing understand that the service will not tolerate reports that are found to be malicious or otherwise made in bad faith, and that such reports may lead to disciplinary procedures Line manager considerations If we are a supervisor or manager, we will: act as role models of professional behaviour support our staff to carry out their professional duties correctly challenge and address any unprofessional behaviour and report it in line with force policies assess, take positive action or otherwise appropriately escalate any report of unprofessional behaviour or wrongdoing made by someone for whom we are responsible take an active and proportionate approach to addressing and reporting unprofessional behaviour encourage and support staff to challenge or report behaviour or service provision that falls below expectations When behaviour does not meet expectations The police service operates on the basis of openness and transparency and is reliant on the trust and confidence of the public. There may be occasions when behaviour does not meet our high expectations, which has the potential to damage our relationship with the public and our colleagues.

We do this through role modelling, clear direction and expectations, appropriate supervision and dealing with issues
