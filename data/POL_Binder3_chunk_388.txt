rhetoric is echoed by leaders like President Zardari, who honored fallen officers for fighting on a ÒfrontlineÓ against criminals and terrorists.14 The most consequential aspect of policing in Pakistan is the broad and deep-rooted ÒthanaÓ culture. Thana cultureÑÒthanaÓ meaning Òpolice stationÓÑis a catch-all term for police abuses ranging from verbal abuse to illegal detention and torture.15 This has resulted in polls showing that 92% of residents disagree that the Lahore police are trustworthy.16 Despite recognition of the issues by police leadership and the public, inadequate training, a culture of physical force, and ineffective grievance processes have persisted, undermining both police effectiveness and public trust in the Pakistani government.17 Policy Idea Reforms must be conducted at the provincial and district levels to implement cultural changes, change training curriculums, and complaint processes. These reforms should include:  Revising police recruitment to emphasize community service and de-emphasize militaristic culture, while reforming the training curriculum to allocate at least half of instruction to de-escalation, conflict resolution, human rights, investigative standards, and community engagement.  Create opportunities at home and abroad for current officers to be retrained and gain advanced skills in areas like policing, forensics, and criminology to overcome established norms in police leadership and incentivize policing reform at lower levels.  Creating transparent independent civilian oversight boards (COBs) at the district level with broad investigative and disciplinary powers.  Creating a publicly accessible national database of police officers, including all investigated complaints against them. Policy Analysis The thana culture in Pakistani policing significantly shapes public perceptions of the government and undermines trust in the justice system. Addressing this culture is key to rebuilding trust, starting with recruitment and initial training as well as additional training opportunities for junior officers. Recruits trained in a more academic, non-stress environment perform better in the field, report higher job satisfaction, and improve public satisfaction.18,19 In contrast, stress-based training creates defensive, impersonal officers, reinforcing problematic and entrenched cultural norms.17,18,20 Some police departments in the US have used similar frameworks to build trust and create community programs such as ÔCeasefire,Õ which resulted in a 37% reduction in homicides in Oakland, CA.21 Recruitment strategies and advertisements also influence the type of candidates who apply, shaping their motivations and expectations for the profession.22,23 COBs provide numerous benefits to improve policing, such as helping complainants feel heard, holding police departments accountable, creating means for mediation, increasing transparency, and educating the public on police work.24,25 However, they can be expensive, depending on the size and expertise of the staff, and localities must have the flexibility to consider cost as they form COBs. Trust and effectiveness of COBs vary and often are seen as inconsistent when they lack authority, access, or transparency in their processes and rulings. Government leadership should preserve these elements, regardless of cost to preserve their effectiveness.25,26,27 A national database of officers would help increase accountability, improve tracking of abuse data, and highlight regionsÕ highest complaints and abuse rates. Making this information fully public comes from the necessity of building trust
