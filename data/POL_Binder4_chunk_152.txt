Audit for Equity: Enhancing Accountability Across New Jerseyâs Harm Reduction Services By Kimia Shahriyar, ks2462@cornell.edu Misallocation of Opioid Settlement Fund grants in New Jersey exacerbates disparities in harm reduction access. Abuse of community-distributor portals necessitates the implementation of audits to protect the integrity of harm reduction and ensure equitable allocation of resources to underserved communities. Background The State of New Jerseyâs Department of Health (DOH) grants agencies across the state harm reduction licenses and funding to enable them to buy and distribute services in their respective communities.1 On February 15, 2024, the DOHâs Division of HIV, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and Tuberculosis Services (DHSTS) made funds available for harm reduction in NJ as per the Opioid Settlement Fund.2 To mitigate harms related to drug use, executive action supports harm reduction services in areas of unmet needs.3 In 2023 alone, the New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition (NJHRC) distributed 10,000 doses of naloxone, effectively used in over 140 overdose reversals.7 Qualifying agencies are awarded funding if they can attest to their capabilities to provide the core suite of harm reduction: preventative care supplies, trauma- informed education, and access to drug-checking equipment.1 Providing these services is costly, and the maximum award per 12- month period to qualifying institutions is $350,000.4 Similar to organizations applying to receive funding from the DHSTS, persons looking to become community distributors must apply through forms specific to the needs of the population they intend to serve.5 Individuals in contact with drug users are encouraged to request anywhere from a few dozen to a hundred kits of various harm reduction supplies like smoking kits, safer injection kits, and naloxone kits.6 The obligation of harm reduction agencies to fulfill requests on behalf of community distributors is a central aim of the expanding harm reduction mailing services. However, the lack of verification standards and processes makes resources liable to misallocation. Given the lack of current-day regulations on request portals, unassuming mailing service coordinators at harm reduction agencies are prone to abuse. There currently are no preventative measures against the very likely possibility of similarly funded agencies depleting supplies through another agencyâs community distributor portal. Policy Idea NJâs DOH should impose distribution audits for all
