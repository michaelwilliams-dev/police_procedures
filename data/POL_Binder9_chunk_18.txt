deals with service of a production order on a government department. Where a production order is served on a government department, it must be served as if the proceedings were other civil proceedings in relation to the department. This means that a p p r o p r i a t e officers should look at the list of government departments published by the Cabinet Office and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland21 under section 17 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 in order to find the correct address for service. A list is set out in annex 2 of Practice Direction 6622 and in Northern Ireland, the Judicial Review Practice Note 1/2008 as revised on 10 October 201323. A production order served on a government department may require any officer of the department (whether named in the order or not) who may for the time being be in possession or control of the material to comply with it. If the order does so require, then the person on whom it is served must take all reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the officer concerned, and any other officer of the department who is in receipt of the order must also take all reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the officer concerned. If the order is not brought to the attention of the officer concerned within the period stated in the order, the person on whom it is served must report the reasons for the failure to a judge of the court which made the order.

If the order is made against a company or other legal persons and there are no directions for service, the appropriate officer should direct the order to a person in authority and with responsibility for the material. 67. When executing a production order, an appropriate officer should ask for the material specified in the production order to be produced. 68. An appropriate officer may remove any material covered by the production order, except where the production order is made under section 345(4)(b) and only allows access to, rather than removal of, the material. 69. An appropriate officer may photograph or copy or have photographed or copied any material that has been removed or accessed. If a copy of the material is sufficient, it should be copied on site and the original returned. If this is not practicable and the order was for production rather than providing access, the material can be taken away and copied and the original returned as soon as possible. 70.
