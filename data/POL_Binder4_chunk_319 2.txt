A defaulter in respect of whom a supervision order is made mustâ keep in touch with the responsible officer in accordance with such instructions as the responsible officer may from time to time give to the defaulter, and notify the responsible officer of any change of address. The obligations imposed by sub-paragraph (4) have effect as a requirement of the supervision order.
