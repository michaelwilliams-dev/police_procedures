different communities. Whilst both men and women can be affected by domestic abuse, females are disproportionately the victims. The latest CSEW data for the year ending March 2020 estimates that 1.6 million females and 757,000 males aged 16 to 74 experienced domestic abuse in the previous year.9 According to this data, around one in four women aged 16 to 74 had been a victim of domestic abuse in their lifetime, compared with around one in seven men.10 The majority of domestic homicide victims are women.11 Data for the period March 2018 to 2020 showed that 276 women were victims of domestic homicide and in 97% of cases the suspect was male.12 Over the same period, 86 men were killed in domestic homicides. In 62% of the cases the suspected perpetrator of these homicides was male, and in 38% of the cases the suspect was female.13 Domestic abuse remains under reported. There can be many barriers to disclosing abuse, seeking criminal justice outcomes, and accessing services.

The CSEW data can be taken to provide estimates of the prevalence of domestic abuse in England and Wales. It is clear that the scale of domestic abuse is vast and its impact is significant. Research published by the Home Office estimated the social and economic costs of domestic abuse to be in the region of Â£66 billion for victims identified in England and Wales within the year 2016 to 2017. Physical and emotional harms (the fear, anxiety and depression experienced by victims as a result of domestic abuse) were estimated to account for the overwhelming majority of the overall costs. The impact on individual victims is severe and can be wide-ranging and long-lasting. Further detail is set out in âChapter 4 â Impact of Domestic Abuseâ.
