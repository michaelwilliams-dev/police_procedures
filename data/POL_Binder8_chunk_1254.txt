the locality and green spaces surrounding their home, including measures to combat crime and anti-social behaviour. The design of buildings and their surroundings can help provide safe places to live and work. We are mindful that the design of a neighbourhood or estate, and the homes within them, can also be a factor in local levels of crime and anti-social behaviour. 102. Landlords are expected to keep homes secure and protected from entry by intruders. But we recognise that we can go further. Physical measures such as CCTV, alley-gating and good quality lighting can all be effective in keeping neighbourhoods safe and secure. We want to explore how we can go further in using the Decent Homes Standard to keep residents secure and help tackle anti-social behaviour. 103. We will review the Decent Homes Standard and consider whether it needs to be updated to ensure it is delivering what is needed for safety and decency now. As a first step the review will consider the case for change. We aim to complete this part of the Review by Autumn 2021. If the evidence demonstrates that we need to revise the Standard, we will consider the strategic, economic and management case for new criteria as a second stage of the review. It is important that any changes to the Standard are affordable and deliverable. We will convene a sounding board of residents, experts, landlords and sector representatives that will review the evidence and support this work. Energy efficiency 104. We are committed to decarbonising our homes. Climate change is a critical global issue, and homes contribute 14% of all UK greenhouse emissions26. Working to address the impact of social homes will contribute to the United KingdomÕs commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and help to reduce residentsÕ energy bills. It will also contribute to our legally binding fuel poverty target and the Energy Performance Certificate Band C aspiration set out in the Clean Growth Strategy. 24 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7812/138355.pdf 25 English Housing Survey Headline Report 2018-19, Table 2.2 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/ attachment_data/file/860076/2018-19_EHS_Headline_Report.pdf 26 https://www.theccc.org.uk/2019/02/21/uk-homes-unfit-for-the-challenges-of-climate-change-ccc-says/ 54 The Charter for Social Housing Residents Ð Social Housing White Paper 105. We will ensure that the Decent Homes review considers how it can work to support better energy efficiency and the decarbonisation of social homes. We recently announced the Green Homes Grant for 2020/2127 which social landlords are eligible to bid for, which will fund up to two thirds of the cost of hiring tradespeople to upgrade the energy performance of homes Ð up to a maximum contribution of £5,000. At the ChancellorÕs summer economic update, the Government announced a £50m demonstrator project28 to start the decarbonisation of social housing over 2020/21. This will encourage innovation and help inform the design of the future Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund. Provision of green spaces 106. In addition to the responses to the social housing Green PaperÕs question on decent homes, COVID-19 is also showing the importance of access to safe, open and green spaces for peopleÕs wellbeing. The importance of
