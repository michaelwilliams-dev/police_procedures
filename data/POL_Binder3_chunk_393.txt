five-point consensus with Myanmar in 2021 to end violence, Myanmar has continued its violent repression.6 Currently, 914,000 Rohingya live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh with no path to citizenship.1 Another 630,000 remain in Myanmar in extreme danger and are unable to escape to Bangladesh, which has forcibly returned 6,000 Rohingya since August 5, unable to support the refugees.7 If decisive action is not taken now, this entire ethnic group risks losing their homeland and chance to preserve their identity. ASEANÕs failure to expel Myanmar reflects their deep economic ties with Singapore-based companies that supplied Myanmar with $254 million in arms between 2021 and 2022, placing ASEAN members among the top arms providers to MyanmarÕs junta.8 Allowing Myanmar to resume participation in ASEAN summits signals that ASEAN tolerates human rights abuses.9 Expelling Myanmar from ASEAN is an essential prerequisite to ending the authoritarian regime in Myanmar. Policy Idea Given MyanmarÕs failure to adhere to ASEANÕs five-point consensus Ñ particularly its disregard for the ceasefire agreement, commitment to peaceful resolution, and worsening human rights abuses against the Rohingya people Ñ ASEAN should suspend MyanmarÕs membership.6 This suspension aligns with ASEANÕs foundational principles of mutual respect, peaceful cooperation, and human rights and serves as a crucial step toward mitigating the conflict. To reinforce this stance, ASEAN should implement a region-wide arms embargo on Myanmar, with a clear mandate that member states who continue trading arms with Myanmar risk their own membership status. This coordinated approach would underscore ASEANÕs commitment to upholding human rights and regional stability and exclude Myanmar from the crucial economic benefits of membership, pressuring the regime to reduce hostilities and align with ASEANÕs standards of governance and peace. Policy Analysis ASEAN has mainly hesitated to expel Myanmar because doing so would eliminate crucial communication channels for diplomatic dialogue, humanitarian aid, and negotiation.10 However, these channels are failing to mitigate MyanmarÕs violence: since ASEANÕs five-point consensus, the military junta has killed at least 5,000 more Rohingya.11,12,13 ASEANÕs current approach is ineffective and there is an urgent need for more drastic action. Removing Myanmar would deny it the economic benefits of ASEAN membership, weakening its military capacity. Southeast AsiaÕs GDP is expected to grow at an annual rate of 5.1%, outpacing China, the US, and Europe.14,15,16 This is largely due to ASEAN initiatives, such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which enables tariff-free trade, protects investments, and secures market access among members.17 ASEAN has also invested $34 billion in research, sharing advancements among members through programs like the One-Shot Campaign, which provides vital vaccination, and invest in environmentally sustainable develepment.14 MyanmarÕs exclusion would remove its access to these critical resources, pressuring the junta to change course. This approach aligns with historical precedent: LondonÕs government cited South AfricaÕs forced withdrawal from the British Commonwealth during apartheid as pivotal in catalyzing global sanctions and isolation, essential for eventual change.18 Similarly, expelling Myanmar would signal that arms deals and economic ties with the junta are unacceptable.
