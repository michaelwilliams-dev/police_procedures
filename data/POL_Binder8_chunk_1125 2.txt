Introduction 1.1. Background This revised statutory guidance on injunctions to prevent gang-related violence and gang-related drug dealing draws on the experience and knowledge of the police service, local authorities and a wide range of local partners involved in dealing with violent gangs. It has been developed and approved by partners across the Criminal Justice System, as well as local practitioners. It has been produced after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice, and has been laid before Parliament by the Home Secretary. The Policing and Crime Act 2009 (Ôthe 2009 ActÕ) contains provisions for injunctions to prevent gang-related violence and gang-related drug dealing activity to be sought against an individual; these were commenced in January 2011. The Crime and Security Act 2010 contains provisions for breach of an injunction to be enforced against 14 to 17 year olds; the Crime and Courts Act 2013 moved jurisdiction for these proceedings from the County Court to the Youth Court. The Serious Crime Act 2015 contains provisions that amend the statutory definition of what comprises a ÒgangÓ, as defined in section 34(5) of Part IV of the Policing and Crime Act 2009, and expands the scope of the activity a person must have engaged in, encouraged or assisted, or needs to be protected from, before a gang injunction can be imposed to include drug dealing activity. 1.2. Terminology used in the guidance Throughout this guidance the term Ôgang injunctionÕ is used to refer to an injunction to prevent gang-related violence and gang-related drug dealing. The individual who is subject to a gang injunction, or against whom a gang injunction is being sought, will be referred to as the ÔrespondentÕ. The police
