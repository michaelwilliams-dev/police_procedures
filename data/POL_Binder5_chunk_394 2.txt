All other penetrations must be 8.0 mm or below. These values are absolute and no rounding is permitted. At energy E2, one penetration in a test series is permitted up to 30.0 mm. All other penetrations must be 20.0 mm or below. As with E1 these values are absolute and no rounding is permitted. Spike is only assessed at energy E1. No penetrations are permitted. 29 Distances specified from the edge of the cut to the edge of the armour and/or the edge of the backing material. 7.3. Energy requirements The stab energy shall be calculated from the recorded velocity and mass of the sabot/blade assembly using Equation (1) and reported in joules to one decimal place. 1 ?? = ????2 2 (1) Where E = energy in joules, m = mass in kg and v = velocity in m.s-1. The energy of each stab shall be within the defined tolerance shown in Table 14. The minimum and maximum values shown are absolute, no rounding up (to minimum) or down (to maximum) is permitted.

Environmental test conditions The test facility, storage rooms and associated areas shall be maintained at a temperature of 20 ± 3¡C and 40 to 70% relative humidity. The working temperature and relative humidity of all areas shall be recorded on the test report. 7.5. Test equipment 7.5.1. Calibration and records The stab sabot and measurement equipment listed in this section shall be calibrated in accordance with internal quality management systems. All accredited test facilities shall have equipment approved by CAST. Calibration records shall be made available to CAST upon request. Details of equipment used during each test shall be recorded on the test report. 7.5.2. Test configuration Figure 22 illustrates a typical test configuration for stab testing.

Guided-mass drop assembly Tests shall be performed using a guided-mass, gravity-driven, drop test assembly. In this assembly, a sabot with a knife or spike end-effector shall be raised to a pre-determined height corresponding with the test energy. The sabot shall then
