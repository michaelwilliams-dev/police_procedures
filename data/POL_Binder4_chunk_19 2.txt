Federally Mandating Insurance for Firearms By Celia Holden, cmh434@cornell.edu To mitigate inaction from the federal government, firearm insurance should be mandated for all gun owners in the United States to incentivize owners to take adequate safety measures. Background In the US, the gun death rate is considerably higher than in most other developed nations (10.6 per 100,000 compared to 1-2 per 100,000 in 2016), and active shooter incidents in the US have risen from 3 in 2000 to 61 in 2021.1 Furthermore, a 2023 survey found that 61% of Americans believe accessing a firearm is too easy.2 However, despite public opinion, the federal government has continued to enact and enforce more lenient gun policies. For example, in 2023, a federal judge in Virginia overturned a statute that prevented people aged 18-21 from purchasing firearms.3 More recently, the Supreme Court overturned a ban on bump stocks, which are devices that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire faster.4 It is evident that not only are guns becoming easier for Americans to access, but the firearms themselves are becoming more powerful as well. Taking action against these rapidly changing dynamics is long overdue, and Americans cannot continue to wait for the federal government to catch up. Private insurance companies should supplement the governmentâs gun safety measures by further incentivizing or requiring gun safety practices with firearm purchases. Policy Idea The federal government will shift gun control to a semi- privatized system where all gun owners are required to insure their firearms, similar to requirements on car insurance or health insurance.
