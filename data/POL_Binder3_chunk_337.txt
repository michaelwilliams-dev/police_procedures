How Universal Pre-K Threatens Child Care Accessibility: A Case for Mixed Delivery By Claudia Nesin, can89@cornell.edu The implementation of universal pre-K programs in many states threatens the economic viability of childcare centers, exacerbating the childcare crisis. States expanding access to universal pre-K should be mandated to do so through a mixed delivery model. Background Advocates tout universal access to preschool as critical for accessibility and equality in early childhood care and education (ECCE). President BidenÕs 2021 American Families Plan called for universal access to preschool for all three- and four- year-olds, and many states have since begun implementing state-funded pre-K programs.1,2 However, these programs have had an unforeseen consequence, putting their benefits at risk and threatening to further degrade our already fraught early childhood system. As public pre-K expands, it drives childcare providers out of business, exacerbating preexisting childcare deserts and driving up childcare costs.3,4 One study found that implementation of public pre-K in NYC reduced one day care seat for every seven four-year-olds who enrolled in the program; alarmingly, every seat lost was in a high- poverty area. The quality of centers near public pre-K facilities also diminished.4 In Tulsa, Oklahoma, where 70% of four-year-olds are enrolled in public pre-K, 43% of all licensed ECCE providers have closed and ECCE costs have risen by an average of 33%.5,6 This issue occurs because private childcare providers derive nearly all of their profit from three- and four-year-olds Ñ providing infant and toddler care actually loses money due to the high staff-to-children ratio it requires.7 The rise of publicly funded pre-K has diminished the number of preschool-aged children in private care, despite the sustained demand for infant and toddler care. A study of nine states and Washington, D.C. found that for every slot of licensed childcare, there are more than five infants and toddlers, over three times the ratio when measuring preschool-aged children.8 Furthermore, 95% of counties studied were
