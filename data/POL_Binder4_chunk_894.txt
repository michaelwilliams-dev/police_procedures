It applies to Wales insofar as it relates to matters in Wales that are reserved to the UK Government â this is primarily policing, and criminal, civil and family justice. In Wales, it is aimed at persons exercising public functions relating to these matters and devolved Welsh authorities must have regard to this guidance in respect to these matters. All organisations in Wales should refer to the relevant Welsh legislation and associated guidance in respect to devolved matters, such as the Violence Against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (Wales) Act 2015 (âthe 2015 Actâ) and its associated guidance. We expect those carrying out devolved and non-devolved functions to continue to work together to implement the purposes of both the 2015 Act and the 2021 Act where relevant and appropriate.
