students to take a semester-long financial literacy course before graduating.4 However, New York lags behind, only requiring an economics course, which is also its own graduation requirement.5,6 New York State (NYS) high school economics courses focus on large-scale market concepts, not practical financial skills students can use in everyday life. The course recommended in New York has four main standards, and only one of the standards, âIndividual Responsibility and the Economy,â has sub-standards on personal finance.7 Within New York, only 20 high schools, about 1.3% of those in the state, require a semester-long personal finance course to graduate.8,9 Evidently, American students lack the financial literacy necessary for long-term success as adults, and NYS must do its part to improve its insufficient financial curriculum. Policy Idea Education should prepare students for life after graduation; therefore, schools must teach financial literacy skills that will be crucial to student well-being in life, regardless of the path they take after graduation. The NYS Legislature should create a graduation requirement that all high schoolers must complete a semester-long financial literacy course. This course will be taken in 12th grade and will teach students the fundamentals of financial literacy, including personal financial knowledge, investment skills, and basic budgeting skills. Students should graduate high school with an understanding of the importance of credit scores, savings accounts, and other practical financial skills. Policy Analysis Research consistently shows that financial literacy education improves financial behaviors and outcomes. States that offer financial literacy courses, such as Georgia, Texas, and Idaho, have reported higher credit scores and lower loan delinquency rates among students who complete these courses.8 Additionally, students who receive a financial literacy education tend to struggle less with debt and report a better quality of life as adults.10 Financial literacy education fosters a sense of security and independence, reducing stress and improving mental health, contributing to overall life satisfaction by equipping students with the knowledge to make informed financial decisions, manage their budgets, and avoid excessive debt.11 Given the success of financial literacy courses in other states, implementing one in NYS is expected to yield similar results. Now more than ever, college is becoming increasingly expensive, with the price increasing 3.63% every year, forcing more students to take out loans than in the past.12,13 Additionally, Gen-Z has the worst debt management skills out of any generation, proving their inability to handle these loans responsibly.14 As this trend continues, it is clear students need help managing their debt, and a financial literacy course would provide significant support. Furthermore, studies show that students who received financial instruction in class were more likely to utilize low-interest college loans compared to their peers.14 Additionally, researchers found that financial literacy courses increased repayment rates among low-income and first-generation students.15 The ideal time to offer the course is 12th grade because students must be versed in financial literacy once they graduate high school, however the topic should be fresh in their minds as they become adults and begin to navigate their finances.
