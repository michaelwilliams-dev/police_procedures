would cost roughly $75-150 per advertisement, which could be covered by the 4 to 1 economic return increased public transportation provides.24, 25 The MTA will also put advertisements on buses and subways, directly reaching eligible riders. To gather community feedback, the MTA will collaborate with community-based organizations in low-income communities to run surveys to determine the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. The Fair Fares expansion will coincide with the NYC congestion tax on January 5th, 2025.14 Advertising will start simultaneously and continue throughout 2025. The MTA will also conduct quarterly ridership and advertising effectiveness evaluations starting in 2026. The success of this program will be measured using quarterly evaluations of ridership growth among Fair Fares users. Given that the MTA already tracks ridership using MetroCard swipes, those who swipe using the special Fair Fares MetroCard would be tracked separately to measure the success of this program specifically. Overall, expanding the Fair Fares program would fight against New York CityÕs income inequality by providing low-income individuals with increased access to jobs that can support their upward economic mobility.
