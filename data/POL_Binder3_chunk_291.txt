economic and social cost incarceration has on families and communities.9 Reducing recidivism, therefore, is not just a criminal justice issue but also a critical economic and social priority. Policy Idea: To help reduce recidivism rates and support released inmates, state policymakers should implement a policy requiring inmates to participate in an educational or vocational training program within the prison as a part of their sentence. Through these programs, prisoners can acquire marketable and valuable skills that can help them rehabilitate into society.10 Skills such as interview etiquette, resume building, and financial literacy can be taught to help inmates search for and secure employment after their release. Furthermore, certification and vocational programs should be provided so inmates can access sustainable employment. Policy Analysis: The current prison system is proving to be unsustainable, and rising recidivism rates add to the economic and social pressure to promote reform.10 Multiple studies demonstrate how educational and vocational programs directly reduce recidivism by decreasing criminogenic causes and alleviating financial burdens. A Research and Development Corporation (RAND) study finds that educational programs reduce recidivism by 13 percentage points.11 The study also showed that inmates who participated in educational programs were 43 percent less likely to recidivate than those who didnÕt participate in the program.11 RAND drew upon also estimated that the educational programs would cost around $1,400 or $1,744 per inmate.11 Comparing this to the average annual cost of incarceration for an inmate being $42,672, educational programs prove to be the most cost-effective solution than incarceration.7 Furthermore, RAND has also estimated that in order for educational programs to be cost- effective and break even, the recidivism rate only needs to decrease between 1.9 and 2.6 percentage points, a relatively easy goal.11 Similar policies such as CaliforniaÕs Proposition 57 have successfully reduced recidivism.12 A component of Proposition 57 allows convictions to utilize rehabilitation programs as a part of sentences.13 The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a report that showed after the enactment of Proposition 57, recidivism decreased by 2.7 percent.14 Furthermore, this proposed policy requires inmates to participate in a rehabilitation program. Current programs do not require inmates to participate in these programs and exclude them from vital resources that provide life-long skills.14 However, if programs are incorporated into sentences, inmates would be required to attend programs and leverage rehabilitation resources. Through this initiative, issues such as mental health disparities and financial illiteracy can be addressed while reducing criminogenic activities after release. Highlights:  Recidivism is not only a product of social inequality but is also a catalyst in driving inequality further. Structural inequalities and generational issues compounded with improper rehabilitation mechanisms further exacerbate criminogenic behaviors and environments.  High recidivism rates are not just a social justice issue; it is also an economic issue. Taxpayers spend $120.59 per day per inmate, amounting to over $60 billion total on prisons.8,16  Prisoners who engage in rehabilitation programs are 43% less likely to re-offend after release.15 These programs directly reduce criminogenic behaviors and causes by providing social
