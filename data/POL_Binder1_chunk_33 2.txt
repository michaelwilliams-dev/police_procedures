(76%). Both these addresses are childrenÕs homes which indicated a potential need for a more robust partnership plan for dealing with such addresses When comparing incident classifications across the five address categories it can be seen that welfare and nuisance incidents account for the highest number of coded incidents. In contrast, across all address categories, acquisitive (household) crime and sexual offences accounted for the least number of incidents, both of which are typically considered as traditional police business. When looking at the incident classifications collectively in terms of Ôtraditional police businessÕ and Ônon-traditional police businessÕ (removing the ÔotherÕ classification) traditional police incidents (acquisitive person and household crime, conditions, vandalism/criminal damage, violence against the person and sexual offences) accounted for 26.89% of incidents whereas non-traditional police incidents (disputes, nuisance, domestic incidents, and welfare) make up 44.78% of incidents. Time Frame Three time frames encompassed the largest demand: 11:01-14:00, 14:01-17:00 and 17:01- 20:00, therefore, with the exception of vandalism/criminal damage incidents, the period between 11:01 and 20:00 was found to be the most resource intensive (see Figure 1). [Figure 1: A chart showing the time frames for incident classifications across the top ten addresses for all categories] When looking at the five categories individually, a similar pattern can be seen. For residential addresses 17:01-20:00 and 20:01-23:00 were the most demanding time frames, for statutory bodies 11:01-14:00 and 14:01-17:00 required the most resources, for retail addresses 14:01- 17:00 and 17:01 Ð 20:00 required the most resources, and young peopleÕs services had a high demand within the time frame 11:01-14:00. Across these four address categories, the majority of incidents fall within one of the three resource intensive periods, with the only exception being the nightlife addresses which held its peak demand at 02:01-05:00 (see Figure 2). [Figure 2: A chart showing the mode time frames for incidents occurring for the 5 categories] Response Coding Across all address categories, the response code (see Table III) given the most was response code 3 (n = 1173, 29.27%) and the response code that was given the least was response code 1 (n = 276, 6.89%). This suggests that the majority of police resources are being used on planned response operations (code 3), and the least demand comes from the need for emergency response (code 1). Response codes given for each of the address category were also examined. Response code 2 was the most frequently used code for responding to incidents at residential addresses (n = 208, 37.55%), whilst response code 5 was the least used (n = 21, 3.79%). For statutory bodies, response code 4 was found to be the most widely used (n = 406, 33.97%) and response code 1 was the least used (n = 59, 4.94%). Overall this indicates that for statutory services, there is little demand for emergency responses and most issues are resolved through a telephone resolution. For the retail category, response code 3 was the most used (n = 355, 37.1%), closely followed by response code 2 (n = 34.38%), whilst
