Introduction The ability of the Wiltshire Police to deliver its policing priorities including public protection, stewardship of resources and to protect its reputation is dependent, often critically dependent, on its ability to manage information and information risks. The Wiltshire Police Executive Leadership Team has stated its commitment to managing information risks effectively and the standard of Information Risk Management (IRM) expected. Implementation of the Wiltshire Police IRM Policy and the basic principles set out in the policy for identification, assessment, management and escalation are mandatory for all Police Officers, Police Staff, 3rd parties, other agency representatives and delivery chain partners. The policy applies to all information risks and sets out accountabilities, how risks are to be managed and performance tracked. What are ÔInformation RisksÕ?

It takes many forms Ð from data sets of sensitive personal data through to records of sensitive meetings, personnel records, policy recommendations, correspondence, case files, intelligence reports and historical records. It exists in many formats from databases through e-Mail, persistent and non persistent messaging, paper, video and digital / magnetic media.
