whether what he has found is something that he is entitled to seize, or the extent to which what he has found contains something that he is entitled to seize, that personâs powers of seizure shall include power under this section to seize so much of what he has found as it is necessary to remove from that place to enable that to be determined. Whereâ a person carrying out a lawful search of any person finds something (âthe seizable propertyâ) which he would be entitled to seize but for its being comprised in something else that he has (apart from this subsection) no power to seize, the power under which that person would have power to seize the seizable property is a power to which this section applies, and in all the circumstances it is not reasonably practicable for the seizable property to be separated, at the time and place of the search, from that in which it is comprised, that personâs powers of seizure shall include power under this section to seize both the seizable property and that from which it is not reasonably practicable to separate it.
