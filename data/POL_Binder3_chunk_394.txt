historical precedent: LondonÕs government cited South AfricaÕs forced withdrawal from the British Commonwealth during apartheid as pivotal in catalyzing global sanctions and isolation, essential for eventual change.18 Similarly, expelling Myanmar would signal that arms deals and economic ties with the junta are unacceptable. Removing Myanmar alongside a clear declaration of removal from the association for member states that partake in trade with Myanmar would affirm ASEANÕs stance against human rights abuses and strain the juntaÕs resources.8 Highlights:  Since 1974, the Rohingya have faced brutal repression, peaking in 2017 when over 700,000 were forced to flee Bangladesh due to military- led violence.1  ASEANÕs failure to effectively address MyanmarÕs atrocities violates its core mission to uphold regional peace, stability, and adherence to international law.5  MyanmaeÕs access to ASEANÕs economic benefits, including tariff-free trade and regional investments, strengthens its regime and undermines ASEANÕs credibility.17  ASEAN must suspend MyanmarÕs membership and implement a region-wide arms embargo to underscore a commitment to human rights while pressuring MyanmarÕs regime to reduce violence. Implementation The rotating ASEAN chair position provides significant influence over the associationÕs agenda, with MalaysiaÕs upcoming chairmanship in 2025 poised to play a pivotal role in advancing a more assertive stance on Myanmar.19 With increasing pressure for decisive action against MyanmarÕs military junta, Malaysia would drive a coordinated approach to suspend MyanmarÕs membership, promoting ASEANÕs commitment to human rights and regional stability.19 As chair, Malaysia could bring the proposal for MyanmarÕs suspension to a formal vote within ASEAN. While this would require unanimous consent, Malaysia can leverage ASEANÕs foundational principles of peace and human rights to build counsense.5 Notably, five of nine ASEAN member states currently support the UN-led arms embargo on Myanmar, including Singapore who is most economically tied to Myanmar.8 Despite SingaporeÕs economic ties to Myanmar, its vote on the embargo highlights a prioritization of international credibility over complicity in genocide. If a suspension vote is called, Singapore and other ASEAN member states with lesser economic ties are likely to support the measure to avoid international condemnation or isolation as the sole dissenting vote. MalaysiaÕs former foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah set a progressive president by openly addressing the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar and building cabinet support for such initiative, laying the groundwork for the current foreign minister, Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan.20 Hasan has emphasizes ASEANÕs responsibility to act decisively on Myanmar, framing the oppression of Muslims in Myanmar as a crisis that transcends internal affairs and demanded unified regional action.21 MalaysiaÕs theme for its chairmanship ÒInclusivity and SustainabilityÓ reinforces its commitment to addressing MyanmarÕs genocide, positioning the country to lead efforts to demand accountability from the MyanmarÕs junta, opening to door for ideas such as removal of the state from ASEAN. Additionally, the newly established Troika mechanism, comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, and LaosÑthe previous, current, and future ASEAN chairsÑprovides a coordinated platform to address the Myanmar crisis.22 This mechanism signals ASEANÕs intent to strengthen its response to the junta's violations and explore solutions beyond the ineffective five-point consensus.
