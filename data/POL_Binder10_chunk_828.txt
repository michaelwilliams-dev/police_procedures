Force policies and procedures provide a definitive reference for staff and, where approved for publication under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the public in a range of areas relating to the business of Wiltshire Police. Policies and procedures are essential for the efficient running of the organisation. They should aim to inform and instruct staff towards a particular approach or course of action to be undertaken when dealing with the core functions of the Force. Policy is often confused with procedures or guidance. Wiltshire Police has therefore adopted the following definitions: Policy is a general high level statement to guide thinking; who, what and why. Procedure is a detailed statement on ÔhowÕ policy is to be implemented or a process carried out. Guidance is a statement of good practice or sensible steps. A policy is a statement (expressed in broad terms) setting out the Forces position or desired position in relation to a relevant and significant issue. It helps people (officers and staff) to exercise good judgement and discretion in the management of daily affairs. Policy should support, and be in line with, the Forces Delivery Plan and Values & Behaviours. Policy should provide a basis for consistent decision-making and resource allocation and should be aimed at assuring consistency and fairness in how those decisions are taken within the framework of the Forces Delivery Plan. Force policy and procedures are binding on all members of the organisation and individuals will be accountable for their actions. Non-compliance may render individuals subject to disciplinary action. Authorised Professional Practice and NPCC Guides sit alongside Force policy and procedures. Wherever possible Force policy and procedures will be aligned to
