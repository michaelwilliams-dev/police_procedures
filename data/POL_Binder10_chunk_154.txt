audit A fire safety audit can be used alongside your fire risk assessment to identify what fire safety provisions exist in your premises. When carrying out a review of your fire safety risk assessment, a pre-planned audit can quickly identify if there have been any significant changes which may affect the fire safety systems and highlight whether a full fire risk assessment is necessary. Plans and specifications Plans and specifications can be required to assist understanding of a fire risk assessment or emergency plan. Even where not needed for this purpose they can help you and your staff keep your fire risk assessment and emergency plan under review and help the fire and rescue service in the event of fire. Any symbols used should be shown on a key. Plans and specifications could include the following:  essential structural features such as the layout of function rooms, escape doors, wall partitions, corridors, stairways etc. (including any fire-resisting structure and self-closing fire doors provided to protect the escape routes);  location of refuges and lifts that have been designated suitable for use by disabled people and others who may need assistance to escape in case of fire;  methods for fighting fire (details of the number, type and location of the firefighting equipment);  location of manually-operated fire alarm call points and control equipment for fire alarms;  location of any control rooms and any fire staff posts;  location of any emergency lighting equipment and the exit route signs;  location of any high-risk areas, equipment or process that must be immediately shut down by staff on hearing the fire alarm;  location of any automatic firefighting systems, risers and sprinkler control valves;  location of the main electrical supply switch, the main water shut-off valve and, where appropriate, the main gas or oil shut-off valves; and  plans and specifications relating to all recent constructions. This information should be passed on to any later users or owners of the premises. 7.2 Emergency plans Emergency plan and contingency plans Your emergency plan should be appropriate to your premises and could include:  how people will be warned if there is a fire;  what staff should do if they discover a fire;  how the evacuation of the premises should be carried out;  where people should assemble after they have left the premises and procedures for checking whether the premises have been evacuated;  identification of key escape routes, how people can gain access to them and escape from them to a place of total safety;  arrangements for fighting the fire;  the duties and identity of staff who have specific responsibilities if there is a fire;  arrangements for the safe evacuation of people identified as being especially at risk, such as those with disabilities, lone workers and young persons;  any machines/appliances/processes/power supplies that need to be stopped or isolated if there is a fire;  specific arrangements, if necessary, for high-fire-risk areas;  contingency plans
