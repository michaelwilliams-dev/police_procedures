Instability and Insecurity in Pakistan: Addressing Police Brutality and Corruption By Zain Ali, zmaa4@cornell.edu The police force is perceived to be the most corrupt institution in Pakistan, broadly accused of bribery, intimidation, torture, and extrajudicial killings.Reforming training standards, oversight, and constructing new cultural and legal frameworks in policing would build trust in police and government. Background Abusive policing in Pakistan traces to the Colonial Police Act of 1861, designed to form a repressive police force for the British Empire, and the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1998 (ACA), designed to address violence by enabling violations of citizenÕs constitutional rights by law enforcement.4,5,6 Calls for reform eventually resulted in Police Order 2002, which aimed to standardize and modernize policing by introducing new standards of oversight, accountability, training, and conduct.7 The implementation of this act has been limited due to the lack of political will and opposition by police leadership.6,8,9 The lack of urgency can be partially attributed to widespread internal security threats.10 Police often justify torture and staged killings as necessary to maintain order, combat terrorism, and out of fear of suspects escaping punishment.11 The first half of 2023 saw 27 reported cases of deaths from police torture.12 Former Inspector General of Sindh explained the prevalence of extra- judicial killings as an expected side- effect of an ineffective judicial system.13 This militarized attitude is conspicuously advertised on province police websites where officers killed in the line of duty are referred to as ÒshuhadaÓ or martyrs.
