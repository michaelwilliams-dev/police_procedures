training, early intervention sys- tems, and civilian oversight. These highly endorsed interventions, however, are not supported by a strong body of empirical evidence that demonstrates their effectiveness. guided by the available research on evidence-based policing and informed by the firsthand experience of one of the authors in implementing departmental reforms that followed the fatal shooting of a civilian by an officer, this article highlights promis- ing reform strategies and opportunities to build the evidence base for effective use-of-force reforms. We call upon police executives to engage in evidence-based policing by scientifically testing interventions, and we call on academics to engage in rapid research responses for critical issues in policing.

After a brief exchange, DuBose, an unarmed 43-year- old black male, was shot and killed by Officer Robin S.

The incident was captured on Tensingâs depart- ment-issued body-worn camera (BWC), but still the circumstances surrounding the shooting were widely debated within the Cincinnati community, sparking protests, independent investigations, civil litigation, and criminal trials. An inde- pendent consulting firm commissioned by the university to perform an external review of the incident found that the shooting was âentirely preventableâ and concluded it was the officerâs âcritical errors in judgment that created an elevated risk of a serious or fatal bodily injuryâ (Kroll 2015, 46). Ten days after the incident, Tensing was indicted by the Hamilton County Prosecutorâs Office for murder. His first criminal trial concluded in November 2015, resulting in a hung jury, while a second trial in June 2017 garnered the same outcome. Concerns regarding racial bias overshadowed the criminal proceedings and flowed into the public discourse. In July 2017, the county prosecutor announced a third trial would not be con- ducted, and the charges against the defendant were dropped.1 This tragic incident and its aftermath sent shockwaves through the Cincinnati community, a city with a troubled history of racial tension and damaged police- community relations (Eck and Rothman 2006); however, it is far from a unique story in American policing. The fatal DuBose-Tensing encounter in summer 2015 occurred amid a spate of other police-involved deaths of unarmed black males.2 Described by Sherman (2018) as the âSecond great Awakening,â the reaction to
