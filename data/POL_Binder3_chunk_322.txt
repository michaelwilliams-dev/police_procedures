Pathways to Mobility: Affordable Public Transportation for Low-Income NYC Residents By Aryan Shah, ans267@cornell.edu The New York City Government and the MTA should provide half-priced subway and bus fares to those living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line in order to combat income inequality in New York City. Background Income inequality in the United States is a growing problem, with the top 10% of households holding 67% of the nationÕs wealth while the bottom 50% possess just 2.5%.1 This disparity is particularly prevalent in New York City, where the wealthiest 20% of Manhattan residents earn, on average, 53 times more than the bottom 20%.2 Statewide, the top 1% earn over 44 times more than the bottom 99%.3 States with higher income inequality have lower life expectancies and higher mortality and obesity rates.4 Public transit provides low- income individuals, who often cannot afford cars, access to jobs to bring themselves out of poverty.5 Residents of the 10 lowest-income city council districts in New York are 45% more likely to commute via bus than the average New Yorker.6 However, the affordability of public transit remains a significant barrier for many low- income households.7 In New York City, as of 2024, 20% of residents reported difficulty affording public transit, rising to 30% among those living in poverty.8 In response to these challenges, the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) introduced the Fair Fares program, which offers half-priced transit for NYC residents living at or below 120% of the federal poverty level. However, only 56% of eligible New Yorkers have enrolled due to a lack of advertising, public awareness, and potentially fare evasion as well.8 Many eligible residents were unaware of the program or unsure how to apply.7 Furthermore, many low-income workers do not qualify for the program because of the enrollment threshold.8 It is clear that expanded public transit assistance for low-income individuals is needed to address the high cost of transit for low-income New Yorkers, which will serve as a critical step in reducing the cityÕs high income inequality levels. Policy Idea To address New York CityÕs extreme levels of income inequality due to inequality in transportation access, the NYC government should expand the Fair Fares program to residents living at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, as the current 120% threshold still excludes some residents who cannot afford transit. This policy would make subways and non-express buses half-price for eligible
