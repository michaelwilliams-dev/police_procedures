private care, despite the sustained demand for infant and toddler care. A study of nine states and Washington, D.C. found that for every slot of licensed childcare, there are more than five infants and toddlers, over three times the ratio when measuring preschool-aged children.8 Furthermore, 95% of counties studied were classified as childcare deserts, a deficit especially pronounced in rural and low-income areas. This absence of childcare forces parents out of the workforce, a burden falling largely upon mothers.9 Additionally, the earliest investments in children bear the highest returns, so inadvertently sacrificing the accessibility of childcare for that of preschool is likely to harm childrenÕs success.10 Policy Idea To mitigate growing threats to already limited childcare accessibility, states implementing subsidization of preschool should utilize a mixed-delivery system that includes both private center-based and home-based care. Mixed- delivery systems enable state and federal funding to support preschool programs in various settings Ñ public schools, center-based care, federally-funded means-tested Head Start preschool programs, religious centers, and, in some states, family or home-based childcare.11 Despite the fact that home-based care serves about three million children, only about half of states that implement mixed-delivery allow family childcare (FCC) providers to receive state funding.12 Home-based care is most utilized by rural families, families of marginalized racial groups, and low-income individuals who prioritize affordability, convenience, and flexible scheduling.2,13 It is also disproportionately provided by women of color.14 The FCC inclusive mixed-delivery funding structure subsidizes the care of private and FCC providers along with public pre-K facilities, helping them retain their preschool-aged children and remain economically viable. Policy Analysis The implementation of a mixed-delivery childcare system that includes FCC providers would facilitate family access to local, high-quality, culturally and linguistically responsive care, available even during non- traditional hours. Mixed-delivery has demonstrated to meet these goals. A report by the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation found that the stateÕs mixed-delivery program successfully increased the accessibility of high-quality ECCE, particularly for low-income families.15 The study also found that the mixed-delivery programÕs investment in ECCE providers enabled them to bolster program quality. Additionally, Colorado has mandated a family childcare inclusive mixed-delivery system for their universal pre-K program in order to prevent the loss of providers and consequent increase in costs and decrease in availability; leverage all existing childcare facilities to maximize accessibility; prioritize familial choice; and account for the diverse needs of distinct communities. The state has already seen success for these initiatives in Denver and Summit County.16 Enabling family childcare providers to access additional funding, such as that obtained through inclusion in preschool subsidization programs, has been demonstrated to prevent closures. In Minnesota, access to Child Care Stabilization Grants through the American Rescue Plan decreased the risk of family childcare provider closure Ñ just 5% of providers who received funding closed during the pandemic, as opposed to 26% of providers who did not.17 This illustrates that the loss of FCC providers is rooted in inadequate funding, rather than disinterest in the field. For underappreciated childcare providers, particularly those responsible for
