strikes required on each size of armour for each protection type (i.e. two small and two large formed armour panels would be required for knife and spike protection). Table 16: Formed armour stab test quantities Panel size No. of panels Energy level No. of strikes Small 1 E1 4 Large 1 E1 4 The protective panel shall be marked in accordance with the positions specified in Section 6.6.3.2. Knife strikes shall be conducted at orientations 0¡, 30¡, 45¡ and 90¡ aligned to the long axis of the protective panel; applied at the discretion of the test facility. Four strikes shall be performed (in this strike order) at positions: left bust tip, right bust tip, top and bottom. CAST reserves the right to identify and assess potential areas of weakness for testing specified to the test facility on approval of the technical file. The same strike locations shall be followed on additional panels for spike testing. 7.6.2.3. Extended coverage For extended coverage panels, separate panels are required for knife and spike testing on each size due to the prescribed locations of the stabs being performed. Table 17 shows the quantities of knife and spike strikes required on different sizes of armour. A single strike shall be positioned in the centre of the panel. All strikes shall be aligned at a 0¡ angle with the long axis of the panel.

Unformed armour testing 7.7.1. Backing materials A composite pack of backing materials described below shall be positioned beneath protective panels in stab testing on unformed armour. This backing material pack (Appendix D) shall comprise (from armour strike face downwards):  2 x 8 mm sheets of AL52N Expanded Nitrile / NBR Sponge;  1 x 8 mm sheet of DK1735 Expanded Firm Neoprene Sponge Rubber;  1 x 30 mm sheet of LD24 Plastazote¨ closed-cell polyethylene foam;  2 x 6 mm sheets of AL55 solid natural rubber. All materials in this pack have dimensions of 400 ? 333 mm (length ? width). The materials shall be configured in the same order as in Figure 28. 2 x 8 mm AL52N 1 x 8 mm DK1735 1 x 30 mm LD24 2 x 6mm AL55 Figure 28: Composite stab backing material pack All backing materials shall be placed in an environment held at a temperature of 20 ± 3¡C and 40 to 70% relative humidity for a minimum of 12 hours prior to testing. All of the composite stab backing materials, excepting the solid natural rubber, shall be replaced after all tests have been conducted for a single certification test or when the foam becomes visibly damaged. The backing materials shall be placed into the stab backing container (Figure 25) for both calibration and stab testing. 7.7.2. Calibration methods Prior to testing, calibration shall be performed on
