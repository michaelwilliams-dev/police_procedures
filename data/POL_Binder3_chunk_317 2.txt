ensure the safety and efficacy of these institutions. The Department of Treasury outlines steps that states like New York can take to monitor their CDFIs, including expressed punishments for violations in the CDFI application, listed illegal and inconsistent practices and clearly expressed ways that CDFIs must contribute to community-level goals.21 Following these standards will create an application system that is free, fair, and economically beneficial to all involved. By enhancing the lending power of CDFIÕs, business growth along the I-90 corridor is expected. When semiconductor jobs come to the corridor as a result of the CHIPS Act, the local economies will already have a baseline for growth. They can appropriately reap the benefits of the federal grant program. By enhancing local economies before the federal grant money becomes available, the New York government can ensure I-90 cities and towns experience steady, upward growth instead of unstable economic swings that may come from an infusion of jobs and factories to areas vastly unprepared to serve them.
