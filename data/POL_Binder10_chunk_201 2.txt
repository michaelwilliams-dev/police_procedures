security risks, and around two-thirds had either a Business Continuity Plan that covers cyber security (67%), or a written list of the most critical data, systems or assets that their organisation wants to protect (64%). As shown Figure 6.1, findings varied considerably by the size of the organisation. Large businesses were more likely to have all three of these arrangements in place (88%, 93% and 81% respectively). Micro businesses on the other hand tended to be less likely to have one of these arrangements in place, with 15% stating that they had none of them at all. 7% of all businesses had none of the risk management arrangements listed, and 3% said they were unsure. There were also some differences by sector. A formal policy or policies in place covering cyber security risks was most common among those in Human Health and Social Work Activities (85%). A Business Continuity Plan that covers cyber security was most common among those in Financial and Insurance Activities (85%). An outsourced provider that manages their cyber security was most prevalent in the sector group consisting of Electricity, Gas and Air Conditioning Supply; Water Supply; Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities; and Transportation and Storage (72%), as well as those in Financial and Insurance Activities (72%). Organisations in the Information and Communication sector and Financial and Insurance Activities were most likely to have board members with responsibility for cyber security (69% and 72% respectively). Those with cyber security practices in place explicitly for AI technologies were more likely to have: An outsourced provider that manages their cyber security (67% vs 58% overall); A formal policy or policies in place covering cyber security risks (87% vs 72% overall); A Business Continuity Plan that covers cyber security (83% vs 67% overall); and A written list of the most critical data, systems or assets that their organisation wants to protect (75% vs 64% overall). Figure 6.1 Governance or risk management arrangements currently in place Source: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question D1. Which of the following governance or risk management arrangements, if any, do you have in place? Base: All (350). When asked about specific cyber security standards or accreditations, as shown in Figure 6.2, 34% of organisations said they adhered to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This compares to 27% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2023.[footnote 4] Around three in ten (29%) adhered to the Cyber Essentials standard, and a further 12% followed the Cyber Essentials Plus standard (compared to 5% and 2% respectively in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey). Just under one-fifth (18%) conformed to the ISO 27000 Standard (compared to 9% of businesses that adhered to the ISO 27001 in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey), and 14% followed any National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards (compared to 3% of businesses that adhered to the ISO 27001 in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey). Around one-quarter of organisations were not adhering to any of these standards (26%), and 14%
