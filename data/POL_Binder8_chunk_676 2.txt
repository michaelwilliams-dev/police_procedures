be noted that those who responded were self-selected and therefore the responses received cannot be considered representative of the views of the public or different sectors in general. 6. The numbers of responses reported in this analysis are actual numbers and have not been weighted. It should also be remembered that not all respondents answered every question. Some responded directly to the questions, some answered only parts of questions, and others commented more broadly on the overall content of the consultation. 28 Annex B Ð List of organisations that responded Abbeyfields Nursery Action for Children Action on Elder Abuse Age UK Association Directors Adult Social Services Association for Sexual Abuse Prevention Association of Child Psychotherapists Association of Colleges Association of Directors of ChildrenÕs Services Association of Independent LSCB Chairs Association of London Directors of ChildrenÕs Services Association of Personal Injury Lawyers Association of Professors of Social Work Association of School and College Leaders Association of Teachers and Lecturers Barham Primary School Barnados Barry Primary School Bedfordshire Safeguarding Team Berkshire Healthcare NHS foundation Trust Birmingham City Council Bishops' CofE and RC Primary School Blackpool Council Blossom House School Boarding Schools' Association Bolt Burden Kemp (Solicitors) Bolton Council Bolton Safeguarding Children Board Boost Child and Youth Advocacy Centre Bournemouth Borough Council Bracknell Forest Council Bradford District Care Breckland District Council Bristol Community Health Bristol Law School British Association Counselling and Psychotherapy British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect British Association of Social Workers (England) British Medical Association British Pregnancy Advisory Service British Psychoanalytic Council British Psychological Society Bromfords School and sixth Form College Cambian Education Cambridge Fire & Rescue Service Cambridgeshire County Council, Adult Safeguarding Team Canterbury Diocese Carolyn Eyre Ltd Castle School 29 Central Bedfordshire Safeguarding Children Board Centre of Excellence for Information Sharing Cheshire East Council Chief Nursing Officer's Black & Minority Ethnic Advisory Group Children's Commissioner's Office Children's Services Operations Central Bedfordshire Council Children's Services Peterborough City Council Chorley District Council Church Safeguarding Consultancy Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service CIS'ters Colegate Community Primary School Coram Campus Cornwall Council Crackley Bank Primary School CYPNAUK Denbigh High School Derbyshire County Council Devon County Council Devon Fire & Rescue Doddinghurst Infant School Doncaster Safeguarding Children Board Dukesgate Academy Durham County Council Elaine Hook Education Consultancy End Violence Against Women Enfield Council Enough Abuse UK Essex County Council Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare Fairhouse Primary School, Essex Family Education Trust Family Justice Council Family Operations Leadership Team, Essex County Council Family Rights Group Flagg Nursery School Ford End C.o.E Primary School Foundation for WomenÕs Health Research and Development (FORWARD) Freedom and Autonomy for Schools national Organisation (FASNA) Gateshead Behaviour Support Service Gateshead Council Gateshead Education Gateshead Local Safeguarding Children Board General Medical Council General Pharmaceutical Council Girlguiding Gloucestershire County Council Gloucestershire Safeguarding Children Board Godolphin and Latymer School Grange primary school Great Ellingham and Rocklands Schools Federation Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust Great Tey Primary School 30 Hampshire Constabulary Hampshire Safeguarding Happy Days Nurseries
