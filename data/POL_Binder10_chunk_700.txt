Salary will be replaced by statutory shared parental pay or pay under Wiltshire PoliceÕs enhanced shared parental pay scheme (if you are eligible for it). Whilst salary will cease, other benefits will remain in place. For example, holiday entitlement will continue to accrue. 7.19 Maintaining Contact Wiltshire Police reserves the right to maintain reasonable contact with you during shared parental leave. This may be to discuss your plans for your return to work, to discuss any special arrangements to be made or training to be given to ease your return to work or to update them on developments at work during your absence. You can agree to work (or to attend training) for up to 20 days during shared parental leave without that work bringing the period of your shared parental leave and pay to an end. These days, which are known as "shared-parental-leave-in-touch" (SPLIT) days, are in addition to the 10 keeping-in-touch days available to an employee during maternity or adoption leave. Wiltshire Police has no right to require you to carry out any work and you have no right to undertake any work during your shared parental leave.
