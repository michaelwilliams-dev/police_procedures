constituents, and publicly pressure Congress members to support human and veteran rights.2,16,17 Upon the billâs successful passage, a DoD report on all current Â§127e operations should be submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services, Veteransâ Affairs, and Foreign Affairs. In order to preserve security interests, closed hearings should be scheduled in each committee for expert witnesses from the DoD to testify on the reports, specify whether or not each operation adheres to an application of Leahy law, and present the operationsâ budgets. As required under the updated code and subject to the required notice of these committees, all operations determined to violate Leahy law will be directed to be safely and promptly terminated within 30 days. All remaining funds dedicated to each canceled operation will be added to the VAâs budget in the next appropriations bill. Once in the hands of the VA, the money can be distributed between rehabilitation programs, providing veterans with the care they need and preventing future violence.
