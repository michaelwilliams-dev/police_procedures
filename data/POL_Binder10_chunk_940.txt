Provisions of Support It is recognised that substance or alcohol misuse problems may develop for a variety of reasons and over a lengthy period of time. They can have a significant impact upon an individualÕs life and their ability to carry out work safely and effectively. Problems can, however, be successfully overcome and it is recommended that they are treated in a similar way to other ill health problems. Early identification and treatment is also important. Individuals suffering from substance or alcohol misuse problems are encouraged to seek help and treatment in overcoming them. Wiltshire Police is committed to providing advice and guidance on overcoming these problems. A referral can be made to OHU who will be able to advise regarding fitness for work issues. Individuals should be strongly encouraged to seek advice/support from their GP. OHU will be able to request medical reports from the GPs in order to maintain a partnership approach. The aim of any support will be to help move an individual with substance or alcohol misuse problems towards a full recovery with a view to facilitating a return to work to undertake the full range of duties commensurate with their role. Appropriate time off work to attend treatment for substance misuse or alcohol misuse problems, as recommended by an individualÕs General Practitioner or the OHU, shall be accommodated where possible.
