[1] Creating an International Recruitment Program to Increase Clinical Specialist Return to Ireland By Zo OÕHalloran, zko2@cornell.edu Specialists often leave Ireland for fellowships abroad, but their emigration is becoming concerningly more long-term. To encourage specialists to return and increase their retention, the National Doctors Training and Planning Unit (NDTP) must coordinate outreach to update them on available consultant positions and healthcare system improvements. Background Ireland is in a Òparadoxical situationÓ involving medical students and healthcare workforce composition.1 Its numerus clausus policies allow unlimited international students to enter Irish medical schools, yet conflictingly provide little opportunity for their further clinical training.1 Consequently, the majority of these students leave after graduation.1 This loss, and the failure to retain medical graduates, classified as non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in later clinical training, contribute to IrelandÕs reliance on foreign doctors. Ireland thus produces Òrelatively more medical graduatesÓ than any other OECD country, yet recruits more Òforeign- trained doctors than any other EU country.Ó1 This reliance contradicts its commitment to the World Health Organization Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, requiring the pursuit of Òa sustainable health workforce.Ó2 For context, NCHDs emigrate at all training stages, but the loss of NCHDs at later stages creates a striking Òbrain drainÓ problem. In Ireland, physicians receive a Certificate of Satisfactory Completion of Specialist Training (CSCST) after specialist training following medical school. CSCSTs, besides general practitioners, typically complete subsequent fellowship training abroad.4 Traditionally, NCHDs temporarily emigrate to better advance in their career and then return to Ireland to work as consultants.1,4 Despite this historical Òtemporary emigrationÓ pattern among CSCSTs, some researchers worry that long-term emigration has increased.1 Although physicians are encouraged to gain specialty experience abroad, there are also negative factors driving their departure, including Òstressful working conditionsÓ with insufficient time allocated to training and a shortage of both Òsuitable consultant postsÓ and Òcareer progression opportunities.Ó3 In particular, there are insufficient Òpost-CSCST fellowships available in IrelandÓ: in 2022, there were only 68 such fellowships but 452 CSCST graduates.4 In 2015, researchers found that
