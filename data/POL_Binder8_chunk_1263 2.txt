In June this year, delivering on a commitment in the GovernmentÕs response to the Veterans Strategy consultation, we published statutory guidance for local authorities to improve access to social housing for members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families. The guidance will ensure that service personnel and veterans suffering from mental health are prioritised for social housing; that those who separate from their partners in the Armed Forces are exempted from any local connection test; and that local authorities can identify applications from members of the Armed Forces community to ensure they are considered appropriately. 36 https://www.cih.org/policy/make-a-stand The Charter for Social Housing Residents Ð Social Housing White Paper 63 Chapter 7: To be supported to take your first step to ownership 64 The Charter for Social Housing Residents Ð Social Housing White Paper We are determined to increase the supply of new and beautiful social homes Ð and to ensure that as many social tenants as possible have the opportunity to buy a home of their own. To increase the supply of social homes, we have:  Built over 486,600 new affordable homes since 2010, including 142,400 for social rent.  Announced our new £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme Ð the largest single investment in social housing for a decade Ð that will deliver up to 180,000 new homes.  Announced a new £3 billion Affordable Homes Guarantee Scheme which aims to provide long- term, low cost and fixed rate debt finance to registered providers.  Removed the cap on local authority borrowing to fund housebuilding.  Consulted on whether greater flexibilities can be offered around how local authorities can use receipts from Right to Buy sales.  Supported community-led housebuilding through the community housing fund.  Announced we will consult on further guidance to provide clarity on rural exception sites policy, to ensure they are used to their full potential.
