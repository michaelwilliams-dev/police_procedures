for Health and Social Care Workforce Planning (NSF).1 As the recruitment policy would fall under the ârevising recruitment strategiesâ objective of âpolicies to address inflows and outflowsâ outlined in the NSFâs Health Labour Market Framework, it would align with current workforce planning goals.2 For the 2016-2019 CSCST recipients, retention rates (measured by the number of recipients working as consultants in Ireland in 2023) were lower in âRadiology, Medicine and Anaesthesiology,â so the recruitment program should prioritize connecting with CSCSTs in these disciplines.4 Additionally, âretention rates of Irish cohorts are on average 12-13% higher than the EU/UK and non-EU cohorts,â so the program should prioritize communication with Irish CSCSTs whose increased retention may result in increased receptivity to outreach.4 Lastly, a 2016 research study found that âthe longer a health professional remained abroad, the less likely they were to return to make their careers in Ireland.â3 The recruitment program should increase outreach âduring the âcritical periodâ in the early yearsâ following emigration.3 While factors such as career prospects lead Irish-trained physicians abroad, throughout post- graduate training, âthe lack of substantive improvements in conditions back in Ireland ...keeps them abroad.â3 The Irish healthcare system could better increase CSCST return by also using the recruitment program to update CSCSTs as NSF implementation results in developments. Highlights Ireland currently has a surplus of medical students yet an inadequate healthcare workforce.1 Irelandâs dependence on foreign- trained doctors is problematically drawing doctors away from low and middle-income countries.1 Despite the historical pattern of CSCSTs emigrating for fellowship training and subsequently returning to Ireland, some researchers worry that their emigration is becoming more common and more permanent.1,4 The NDTP should create an international recruitment program for doctors who received their CSCSTs in Ireland. It should contact those who receive their CSCSTs in Ireland but are not actively registered with the IMC when (1) there are recruitment opportunities for consultants and (2) there are improvements made in the Irish healthcare system to encourage their return. As the NDTP monitors the DIME database for workforce planning, it should monitor the recruitment campaign's targets and conduct surveys of those who return to determine whether the outreach influenced their decision. Implementation The NDTP, which maintains DIME, could implement an international recruitment program. Gaining the support of the NDTPâs Medical Workforce Planning Lead, Dr. Roisin Morris, and of DIME Project Managers, Orla Smith and Aoife Nolan, would be instrumental in creating this program.6 As the NDTP, the IMC, postgraduate medical training bodies, and clinical sites collaborate to collect DIME data, critical officials in these other organizations must also champion this policy for it to be successful.5 DIMEâs utility for tracking physicians leaving and returning from Ireland hinges on using each doctorâs IMC number as a âunique identifierâ because it does not change as they migrate.4 As such, ensuring the IMCâs support in using this information and physician contact details to organize outreach is critical. In particular, obtaining encouragement from the IMCâs Registration and Continuing Practice Committee could facilitate the fastest possible implementation
