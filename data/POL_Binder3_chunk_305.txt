would significantly reduce power outages, lower maintenance costs, and modernize infrastructure to accommodate future energy demands and renewable power integration. Policy Analysis The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced a $34 million pilot program to develop a dozen advanced technologies through the Grid Overhaul with Proactive, High- Speed Undergrounding for Reliability, Resilience, and Security (GOPHURRS) for the implementation process of underground power lines including the creation of a worm-like digging tool.8 $4 million was directed to improving an AI-driven digital subsurface obstacle detection system. An additional $4 million grant was allocated to establish a sensing platform using radar and radio frequencies to locate existing utility lines. Investments like this are aimed at reducing construction costs for underground systems.8 Converting traditional alternating current (AC) powerlines to direct current (DC) systems can enhance transmission efficiency and decrease overall electrical consumption. Companies in industrial computing, LED technology, solar energy, and electric vehicles increasingly adopt DC power and develop methods to convert currents at various voltages.9,10 High-voltage DC (HVDC) lines transmit nearly double the voltage of AC lines and offer greater stability over long distances.11 While High Voltage AC (HVAC) transmission has traditionally been cheaper, accounting for terminal converter station costs makes HVDC exponentially more cost-effective at distances greater than 600 km above ground or between 50 and 90 km underground.9 Using DC distribution systems in households with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels can reduce energy use by 9-20%, and up to 14- 25% when combined with battery storage.9 Despite high initial implementation costs, HVDC infrastructure is a cost-effective long-term solution, particularly for East Coast development. New York State Assembly Bill 2330-A directed a feasibility study on underground transmission lines, finding such projects economically viable in densely populated areas prone to extreme weather.6 Underground grids reduce FEMAÕs reconstruction costs and can pay for themselves after two damaging weather events.14 Studies indicate that upfront investments in underground powerlines lead to long-term savings by reducing fire damage and improving public health.12,13 Highlights  Catastrophic environmental events are becoming more intense and frequent with global warming, costing $22.8 billion per event, creating an immediate need for climate-efficient grid enhancements.3  High-voltage direct current (HVDC) power lines are cost-effective when implemented at distances greater than 50 to 90 kilometers underground, establishing economies of scale in long-term integration.9  DC power is more reliable and resilient compared to alternating current (AC) power and expands the grid for renewable energy integration, leaving room for large-scale implementation.3,9  This policy would address upfront investments through an integrated tax system to incentivize the implementation of high- voltage direct current underground power by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, utility companies, and local and state government programs like the Grid Overhaul with Proactive, High-Speed Undergrounding for Reliability, Resilience, and Security (GOPHURRS).8 Implementation This policy proposes an incentive agreement among state governments, FEMA, and local utility companies, funded through tax incentives and small utility bill surcharges. Modeled after New YorkÕs Inflation Reduction Act homeowner credits, utility companies will receive up to 30% tax credits.15 A
