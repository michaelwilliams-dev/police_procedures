of documenters, for SDP police officers specifically it is reinforced by two characteristics of the papers with which they deal. First, their status as administrative procedures and the lack of importance that follows from it. Sec- ond, the incongruence between material elements and narrative conventions present in these papers and the case plots registered therein. The specific VPIs that circulate within the SDP are initiated in Rio de Janeiro city police precincts. The precincts are first reported of "missing persons" cases by people classified by police officers, often regardless of factual connec- tions or blood ties, as "families of missing persons". Once a "family of missing person" reports a case in a precinct, a police officer must open a VPI. Some time after this initial step, VPIs must be forwarded to the SDP for specialized investigations15. Unlike police inquiries, VPIs are administrative procedures initiated for non-criminal occurrences. The central issue, however, is not their distinct nature but rather the different status attributed by police officers to VPIs and inquiries. Police officers, reproducing the hierarchy implicit in the distinction between "real crimes" and "feijoada", understand that inquiries are properly police documents and, thus, endowed with evident relevance, while VPIs are, in their words, "only administrative procedures", unimportant, incapable of revealing the "reality" of police work and, for this very reason, liable to being touched, read and transcribed even by a researcher16. Nonetheless, within the heterogeneous universe of VPIs, police officers understand that those initiated for "missing persons" cases are even less important than the rest. Using this other informal classification, that at times is added to the separation between "real crimes" and "feijoada", SDP police officers often state that "missing persons" cases are "family affairs", in opposition to "police matters". While homicides, kidnappings and robberies, among others crimes, are "police matters" demanding street operations, team investigations and other activities part of "police work", "missing persons" cases are, to sector agents, "family affairs" that should not be left up to police units. Police officers say that, when faced with these cases, they have little to do but "to fill out pieces of paper" (cf. Ferreira, 2013) and to tend to the so-called "families of missing persons", carrying out a type of service they classify as "social work"17. Inspector Fernando usually bases the use of informal classifications such as "family affairs" and "social work" on one of the main state narrative and administrative genres: official statistics, in this case produced by the Rio de Janeiro Public Security Institute (Instituto de Segurana Pblica ? ISP). For some years, ISP has claimed, based on quantitative data that the majority of "missing persons" cases reported to the state's precincts end with the return of the missing persons to their homes or at least with the discovery of their whereabouts18. For Fernando, that data prove what he sees everyday: that most occurrences are family conflicts leading to someone running away from home, to couples separating or to one of the persons involved in the conflict explicitly deciding
