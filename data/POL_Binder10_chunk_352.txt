It will be for individual Category 1 or 2 responders to reach a decision about whether the information they hold is sensitive. But there are a number of general points that should affect the decision: o all Category 1 and 2 responders should work on the presumption that information requested should be disclosed. Non-disclosure should only occur in exceptional cases, such as where there are clear national security or commercial implications. o where the Category 1 or 2 responder knows that the information has originated from the intelligence services and that disclosure to the public would threaten national security, then the information must not be disclosed unless consent is obtained from the originating services. Where the Category 1 or 2 responder suspects that the information has originated from the intelligence services, or that it may be sensitive for reasons of national security, it should consult with the originator of the information. o in considering national security implications, note that the test is whether disclosure to the public would threaten national security, not whether disclosure to the requesting Category 1 or 2 responder would threaten national security.

However, use of non-sensitive information may be limited by duties of confidence, by other enactment or by contract. 3.29. There are unlikely to be any restrictions on the use to which a Category 1 or 2 responder can put any non-sensitive information which it creates in the course of carrying on its duties under the Act; for example an emergency plan √ê though an emergency plan may contain information that has been supplied by another Category 1 or 2 responder, and the use to which this information may be put may be subject to limits. It is also important to be mindful that information is sensitive
