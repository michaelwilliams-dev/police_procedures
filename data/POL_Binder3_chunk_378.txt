will not have to win over each one to push the new legislation across the finish line. As many major automakers are now well-established in the electric vehicle market, they will likely support the policy too, as it might induce non-car owners to purchase an EV as their first car. A bipartisan group of senators, akin to the legislative process for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, could be highly effective at working out a comprehensive framework that appeals to conservatives invested in climate solutions. The implementation of the policy can follow the existing legislation signed into law by President Biden subsidizing EVs (the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law), but this new legislation will have to be more spatially targeted. The legislation will have to target communities of concern, namely those that are not located near any existing charging stations, and the legislation language will have to be strict that funds are conditional on being spent in said communities.
