be present to track wounded deer and prevent unnecessary suffering. 13.30 There is no longer a requirement to use larger calibre rifles for night shooting; controllers must ensure firearms meet minimum requirements as set out in paragraph 13.15. 13.31 Use of head and neck shots are not recommended for night shooting. As with all other authorisations, minimising the risk to public safety and protecting animal welfare are the controllerÕs responsibility. 13.32 For Scotland, further advice on the 1996 Act and its revisions can be obtained from NatureScot. 122 Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law 13.33 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (Òthe 1981 ActÓ) makes it a criminal offence to intentionally kill, injure or take any wild bird (in England and Wales, game birds are similarly protected by the Game Act 1831). However, quarry species (listed in Schedule 2, Part I) and game bird species (listed in section 2 of the Game Act) may be killed during prescribed open seasons. In certain circumstances an Ôauthorised personÕ is also permitted to kill or take certain species during the closed season covered by General or Individual Licences. 13.34 Copies of General Licences are available online at the following links: England - Natural England Wales - Welsh Government Scotland - NatureScot 13.35 Individual Licences may be issued by wildlife licensing authorities to individuals or groups of people. Section 27 of the 1981 Act does not define game birds separately from wild birds; game birds such as common pheasant and red grouse are captured by the definition of Ôwild birdsÕ. It is possible to shoot them in the open season without a licence, and they are listed in Schedule 2, Part I as per other quarry species, but a licence is required to shoot them in close season (see paragraphs 13.47 and 13.48 below). The definition of a game bird in section 27 of the 1981 Act was repealed in Scotland (see section 2 of the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011), with the result that game birds are not defined separately from wild birds in Scotland 13.36 A number of animals are protected under Section 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) via their inclusion in Schedule 5 of the Act. These species include: i. red squirrels, ii. dormouse, iii. water voles and iv. adders. 13.37 In England and Wales, those animals that are known as European Protected Species (including all bats, otters and whales) are included in Schedule 5 for certain offences, but receive protection mainly from the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/1012) in England and Wales. In Scotland, European protected species receive protection through the 2010 Regulations (SI 2010/490) for reserved matters and through the Conservation (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1994 (SI 1994/2716) (as amended in Scotland). 13.38 It is an offence under section 9(1) of the 1981 Act to intentionally kill, injure or take any species listed in Schedule 5. Section 9(4) states that the intentional or reckless damage,
