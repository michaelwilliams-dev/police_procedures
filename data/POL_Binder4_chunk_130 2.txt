commitment to human rights while pressuring Myanmarâs regime to reduce violence. Implementation The rotating ASEAN chair position provides significant influence over the associationâs agenda, with Malaysiaâs upcoming chairmanship in 2025 poised to play a pivotal role in advancing a more assertive stance on Myanmar.19 With increasing pressure for decisive action against Myanmarâs military junta, Malaysia would drive a coordinated approach to suspend Myanmarâs membership, promoting ASEANâs commitment to human rights and regional stability.19 As chair, Malaysia could bring the proposal for Myanmarâs suspension to a formal vote within ASEAN. While this would require unanimous consent, Malaysia can leverage ASEANâs foundational principles of peace and human rights to build counsense.5 Notably, five of nine ASEAN member states currently support the UN-led arms embargo on Myanmar, including Singapore who is most economically tied to Myanmar.8 Despite Singaporeâs economic ties to Myanmar, its vote on the embargo highlights a prioritization of international credibility over complicity in genocide. If a suspension vote is called, Singapore and other ASEAN member states with lesser economic ties are likely to support the measure to avoid international condemnation or isolation as the sole dissenting vote. Malaysiaâs former foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah set a progressive president by openly addressing the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar and building cabinet support for such initiative, laying the groundwork for the current foreign minister, Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan.20 Hasan has emphasizes ASEANâs responsibility to act decisively on Myanmar, framing the oppression of Muslims in Myanmar as a crisis that transcends internal affairs and demanded unified regional action.21 Malaysiaâs theme for its chairmanship âInclusivity and Sustainabilityâ reinforces its commitment to addressing Myanmarâs genocide, positioning the country to lead efforts to demand accountability from the Myanmarâs junta, opening to door for ideas such as removal of the state from ASEAN. Additionally, the newly established Troika mechanism, comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, and Laosâthe previous, current, and future ASEAN chairsâprovides a coordinated platform to address the Myanmar crisis.22 This mechanism signals ASEANâs intent to strengthen its response to the junta's violations and explore solutions beyond the ineffective five-point consensus. Advocating for Myanamrâs suspension aligns with ASEANâs historical principles and enhances its credibility on the global stage. A suspension would signal ASEANâs intolerance for human rights abuses and restrict Myanmarâs access to arms and economic resources. This unified regional stance would exert significant pressure on the junta, challenging its ability to sustain the oppressive regime and advancing efforts to resolve the humanitarian crisis.
