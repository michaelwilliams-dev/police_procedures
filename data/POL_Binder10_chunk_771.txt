that you are linking to the correct existing record o If you are uncertain or do not have enough information to match an existing record, you may create a new record but if you think you have created a new duplicate, you must contact the DQT so they can investigate further  Only use well known Wiltshire Police acronyms and abbreviations in OEL entries, reports and statements. Make sure your audience will understand them  Create a new business address for each new business  Create an alias for alternative spellings, nicknames and hashtags (online names etc)  End-date all contact information which has been confirmed as no longer up to date or relevant, this includes address records, telephone numbers, email addresses etc. Do not:  Set up a partial or unknown address o Including information which is known to be inaccurate, such as misspelled street names and unconfirmed postcodes.  Create an ÔUnknownÕ or ÔAnonymousÕ record when we have little to no information o Refer to the 4+1 standard where possible and local practice for suspects  Create a record for ÔUnbornÕ children.
