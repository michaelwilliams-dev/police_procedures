state from ASEAN. Additionally, the newly established Troika mechanism, comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, and LaosÑthe previous, current, and future ASEAN chairsÑprovides a coordinated platform to address the Myanmar crisis.22 This mechanism signals ASEANÕs intent to strengthen its response to the junta's violations and explore solutions beyond the ineffective five-point consensus. Advocating for MyanamrÕs suspension aligns with ASEANÕs historical principles and enhances its credibility on the global stage. A suspension would signal ASEANÕs intolerance for human rights abuses and restrict MyanmarÕs access to arms and economic resources. This unified regional stance would exert significant pressure on the junta, challenging its ability to sustain the oppressive regime and advancing efforts to resolve the humanitarian crisis.
