that may be brought into force at a future date. Changes that have been made appear in the content and are referenced with annotations. (See end of Document for details) View outstanding changes that anything which is found, on that examination, not to fall within subsection (3) is separated from the rest of the seized property and is returned as soon as reasonably practicable after the examination of all the seized property has been completed; and that, until the initial examination of all the seized property has been completed and anything which does not fall within subsection (3) has been returned, the seized property is kept separate from anything seized under any other power. The seized property falls within this subsection to the extent onlyâ that it is property for which the person seizing it had power to search when he made the seizure but is not property the return of which is required by section 54; that it is property the retention of which is authorised by section 56; or that it is something which, in all the circumstances, it will not be reasonably practicable, following the examination, to separate from property falling within paragraph (a) or (b). In determining for the purposes of this section the earliest practicable time for the carrying out of an initial examination of the seized property, due regard shall be had to the desirability of allowing the person from whom it was seized, or a person with an interest in that property, an opportunity of being present or (if he chooses) of being represented at the examination. In this section, references to whether or not it is reasonably practicable to separate part of the seized property from the rest of it are references to whether or not it is reasonably practicable to do so without prejudicing the use of the rest of that property, or a part of it, for purposes for which (disregarding the part to be separated) the use of the whole or of a part of the rest of the property, if retained, would be lawful. Obligation to return items subject to legal privilege If, at any time after a seizure of anything has been made in exercise of a power of seizure to which this section appliesâ it appears to the person for the time being having possession of the seized property in consequence of the seizure that the propertyâ is an item subject to legal privilege, or has such an item comprised in it, and in a case where the item is comprised in something else which has been lawfully seized, it is not comprised in property falling within subsection (2), it shall be the duty of that person to secure that the item is returned as soon as reasonably practicable after the seizure. Property in which an item subject to legal privilege is comprised falls within this subsection ifâ the whole or a part of the rest of the property is property falling within subsection (3) or
