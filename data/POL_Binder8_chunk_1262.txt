and focus groups with representatives from across the sector. The results will be published shortly and we will consider the findings to ensure that housing is allocated in the fairest way possible and achieves the best outcomes for local places and communities. This will include considering:  how to improve joint working between local authorities and housing associations to ensure that social housing is being allocated efficiently;  how to remove barriers to access to social housing for homeless households; and  how to ensure vulnerable households are able to navigate local authoritiesÕ allocation systems. 135. While the allocation legislation ensures that people with disabilities are prioritised for social housing, we heard that that allocation systems sometimes fail to match adapted (or adaptable) homes to the people who need them, often because of a lack of data about the accessible social housing stock in the area.

Landlords must work with local authorities to deliver this requirement, and it is important that this expectation is reflected in the regulatory standards.

Supporting the Armed Forces community 138. We are committed to ensuring that those who have put their life on the line for their country, and those who give up so much to support them to do so, get the priority for social housing they deserve. 139. Delivering on the Armed Forces Covenant the Government changed the law in 2012 so that seriously injured, ill or disabled Service personnel, and former members of the Armed Forces, with urgent housing needs are always given high priority for social housing.

Both of these changes apply also to bereaved spouses or civil partners who have to leave Ministry of Defence provided accommodation, and
