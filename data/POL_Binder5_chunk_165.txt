Culling of Dependent Young 13.14 Section 6(2A) of the 1991 Act, as inserted by the 2007 Order, provides that it is not an offence for a person to take or kill a deer during the close season or at night where he reasonably believes the deer has been deprived of a female deer on which it was dependent or is about to be deprived as a result of disease or lawful taking or killing of a female deer on which it is dependent.
