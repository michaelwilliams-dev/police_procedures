In the case of dealers authorised to manufacture, sell or transfer prohibited weapons, there is no discretion to refuse to enter their names in, or to remove them from, the register of dealers (sections 34(3) and 38(2) of the 1968 Act). When an authority is revoked, any firearm certificate relating to the weapon or ammunition in question must be revoked or varied accordingly (section 31(2) of the 1968 Act).

If such a case should arise, a full report should be made to the Home Office or the Scottish Government (as applicable) as soon as possible. 3.16 Under section 12(2) of the 1968 Act (as amended) (a parallel provision to Section 12(1) of the 1968 Act), an authority to possess prohibited weapons issued to a theatrical or cinematograph film producer may authorise the possession of the weapons by such other persons as the producer may select to have possession thereof whilst taking part in the performance, rehearsal or production. 3.17 Section 5(4) of the 1968 Act provides that an authority shall contain conditions for the purpose of ensuring that the prohibited weapon or prohibited ammunition will not endanger the public safety or the peace. Conditions are stipulated by the Home Office or the Scottish Ministers (and these will vary in individual cases) although the opinion of the chief officer is also sought. Section 5(5) of the 1968 Act makes it an offence to fail to comply with any conditions subject to which an authority is granted.
