The aim of the fire risk assessment is to:  Identify fire hazards.  To reduce the risk of those hazards causing harm to anyone to as low as is reasonably practicable.  To decide on what physical precautions and management arrangements are required to ensure the safety of people within the building. It is the responsibility of the manager with overall responsibility for the building / premises to ensure any recommendations / actions are carried out within the defined time scales. The findings of the fire risk assessments will be recorded on Form 411 and copies of the completed fire risk assessments will be sent to the relevant manager with overall responsibility for the building/premises. Copies will also be placed in the local Fire Logbook. In the case of shared sites or joint ownership locations, the fire risk assessments will also be sent to the landlords, site sharers and other relevant persons for information /action as required.
