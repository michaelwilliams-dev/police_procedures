property, or o has, at any time, held property that was recoverable property or associated property at the time;  the reasonable grounds for believing: o that customer information which may be provided in compliance with the order is likely to be of substantial value (whether or not by 36 Section 416(4). itself) to the investigation for the purposes of which the order is sought; and o it is in the public interest for the customer information to be provided, having regard to the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation if the information is obtained. Particular action to be taken before an application for a customer information order is made 126. The appropriate officer must carefully consider his existing evidence and information so as to limit the number or scope of financial institutions. This may include researching NCAÕs intelligence system and the Police National Computer. They must consider what benefit the customer information they may obtain may have, either in itself or as the lead to other avenues of investigation.
