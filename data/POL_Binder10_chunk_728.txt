to reach out to a colleague instead of a supervisor or HR. We encourage colleagues to support one another when needed. 8. Employee Recognition and Development One way to prevent our employees from excessive stress is to recognize their work and invest in their personal growth. For this reason, we have established:  Reward Recognition programs  Mentorship programs  People development programs  Talent management Board 9. Compliance with the law The law protects employees who suffer from medical conditions (e.g. clinical depression) or mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia.) Consistent with our non-discrimination practices, we will treat these employees fairly and we wonÕt oblige anyone to disclose their condition or other medical information. Instead, we will attempt to support employees who come to us with mental health issues and establish strategies that apply to everyone, and provide confidential advice / support via the Occupational health unit. We will make reasonable adjustments for people with mental disabilities. 10. Evaluating Outcomes We will test its elements to find out what works and what doesnÕt. We will continuously research mental health topics and evaluate the results of our policy with managersÕ help. We will develop, revise and establish policy, we need everyoneÕs help. We can all work to define mental health issues, their causes and seek or offer help when needed. We encourage employees to share their ideas and concerns.
