Water Resource Issues in the American Southwest By William Dignam, wed45@cornell.edu With wildfires and droughts becoming more common in the American Southwest as a result of climate change, developing sustainable agricultural practices and new technologies can help defend against the water issues the region will face. Background Agriculture practices use around 70% of global freshwater resources.1 Current agriculture practices and water resource management face increasing pressure to meet the rising global demand for food sustainably while concurrently conserving water and protecting the environment. Furthermore, certain areas of the world are more prone to drought issues and weather events that affect water resources. The Southwestern United States is particularly vulnerable to drought and water scarcity due to its arid climate and reliance on limited water sources. According to a recent study published in the Nature Climate Change journal the 22-year drought affecting Southwestern North America has been the region's most severe megadrought since at least the year 800 AD.2 The Southwest is home to three main watersheds that stretch across Texas, Arizona, Utah, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Nevada. The Colorado River watershed is especially significant as it provides water for millions of people, supports large agricultural areas, and sustains ecosystems.3 However, droughts and increasing water demands from urban and agricultural systems are decreasing the riverÔs flow rates and depleting its reservoirs.3 The intricate network of watersheds in the Southwest highlights the need for collaborative water management practices and technologies among Southwestern states to allocate water resources equitably and efficiently. Innovative solutions, such as improving irrigation methods using analysis tools, utilizing AI and machine learning for resource efficiency, addressing water adoption, drought-resistant crop varieties, and investing in water recycling and desalination technologies, are essential to address the regionÔs water challenges. Using these and other agricultural technologies in the Southwest and the rest of the United States will drastically improve water resources. Policy Idea Congress could enact a comprehensive Southwest Agricultural Innovation and Resilience Program (SAIRP), which combines federal and state efforts under a single, unified framework. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would manage a $5 billion federal loan and grant initiative to fund this program. It would provide federal backing targeting innovative companies in Silicon Valley, such as vertical farming start-ups like Plenty and Bowery Farming, and agri-tech leaders like John Deere, as well as large agricultural ventures in the Southwest, including groups like DriscollÔs Farms that specialize in water conservation.4,5 The program would allocate funding to businesses developing water- efficient irrigation systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, and advanced soil health monitoring technologies, supporting the development and implementation of innovative water-saving and crop- enhancing technologies. States can initiate pilot programs and demonstration projects that showcase the potential of agricultural technologies in real- world settings. Policy Analysis Specific technologies show potential in the Southwest. Solutions like N-DripÔs gravity- powered drip irrigation system help farmers conserve water by replacing the outdated flood irrigation method still used in nearly 40% of the regionÔs farms.6 This system can reduce water use by up to
