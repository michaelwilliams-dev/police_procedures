The amount they are entitled to is dictated by those terms, however the means through which such leave is managed within Wiltshire Police and the OPCC is via this Procedure, which incorporates any relevant legislative requirements. A period of annual leave is an approved period of absence from the workplace. This Procedure aims to provide a managed framework that allows staff to plan and take their leave whilst ensuring that operational efficiency is maintained. All staff have a personal responsibility to plan their leave throughout the leave year, to ensure that they take regular managed breaks from the workplace to maintain their health and wellbeing and to avoid the risk of losing untaken leave at the end of the leave year. This procedure is intended to inform you of the various types of leave available to an individual. This procedure refers to Police Staff, OPCC staff and Police Officers unless otherwise stated.
