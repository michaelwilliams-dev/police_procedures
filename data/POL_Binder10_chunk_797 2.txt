It is a nationally hosted system which holds copies of records relating to crime, intelligence, custody, child protection and domestic abuse from all UK police forces and other law enforcement agencies. It allows users to search actual data records covering Persons, Organisations, Organised Crime Groups, Objects, Locations and Events (also known as POLE). This policy is effective immediately and applies to all police officers and police staff who have a requirement to access the PND, either as a direct user or as a requester of information from the system. This policy sets out clear guidance for Wiltshire Police about the minimum standards for the use of the PND in line with the statutory Code of Practice and national standards. This policy covers the management and use of the PND within the scope defined by the Code of Practice on the Operation and Use of the PND as defined by section 39A of the Police Act 1996 (inserted by section 2 of the Police Reform Act 2002). PND Operating Model It is essential that the PND is used consistently across the Police Service and in compliance with legal and policy requirements. This will provide chief officers with confidence that the information they provide is being used appropriately by other forces. Our access to and use of the PND is Conducted in accordance with the Code of Practice on the Operation and Use of the PND and National Standards as defined by the College of Policing. All information obtained by use of the PND will be handled in a way consistent with its protective marking set by the originator, retained securely and disposed of when no longer required. Information on PND is for intelligence purposes only and not to be used as evidence. This policy will ensure that our use of the PND and its information assets will be in compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Code
