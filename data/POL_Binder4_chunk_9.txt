the programâs scope while increasing its financial feasibility. Focusing on non-violent offenders prioritizes lower-risk individuals, making the initiative affordable and appealing to the public. The American Correctional Association and the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) must ensure fair wages by aligning prison labor pay with living costs. Additionally, non-violent inmates granted parole would be required to establish mandatory savings accounts â with a minimum of 80 percent of inmatesâ total wages, considering their minimal financial responsibilities â which they can access upon release. While some may argue that incarcerated individuals do not deserve higher wages due to their criminal record, fair pay reduces reoffending rates and supports successful reintegration, ultimately enhancing public safety. Policy Analysis Empirical evidence supports financial stabilityâs role in reducing recidivism rates.9 Research at the University of Southern California (USC) reveals that economic stability is directly correlated to reduced recidivism as criminal behavior is closely linked to income levels.9 Beyond USC, College Bound Dorchester, a Boston-based non-profit, has given those with a criminal record in Richmond, California, a $400 weekly stipend.10 Over the next seven years, the city saw a decrease of over 50 percent in its homicide rate, with research suggesting a causal link to the stipend program.10 Both USCâs research and the Dorchester program exemplify the correlation between financial stability and reduced recidivism. Additionally, investing in living wages for incarcerated individuals could be cost-effective as studies show that a one percent increase in economic freedom is correlated with a 0.47 percent decrease in recidivism.11 With annual housing costs at $60,000 to $70,000 per inmate, reducing recidivism and lowering the number of inmates is cost-effective.12,13 Moreover, since incarcerated individualsâ wages are subject to deductions that prisons retain with federal, non-incarcerated taxpayer money, paying inmates a livable wage could reduce the financial burden on taxpayers, shrink the excessive profit margins of private prisons, and reduce recidivism rates.3 Reducing private prison profits is crucial because it removes the financial incentive for companies to keep incarceration rates high.14 In turn, the justice system can refocus on rehabilitation and public safety. Further, international examples support this approach. In Norway, where recidivism rates lie at 20 percent, prisons provide incarcerated individuals with wages competitive with civilian wages.15 Incarcerated individuals are given spending freedom, exercising responsibility that translates to future reintegration. Implementing a savings account program in NYS, would provide a similar financial foundation, directly contributing to reduced recidivism and smoother reintegration.15 Highlights 32,613 individuals are incarcerated in New York State (NYS), with two-thirds of them working in industry and non-industry jobs.1 The Thirteenth Amendment and the Fair Labor Standards Act jointly enable prison labor practices that do not meet the ethical labor standards that are upheld for non-incarcerated individuals.2 Incarcerated individuals rely on their wages to support their families and have limited financial ability to do so with an average hourly wage between $0.10 and $0.33.3 Studies show a clear link between financial stability and reduced recidivism rates, with Norwayâs implementation of fair wages for incarcerated individuals resulting in
