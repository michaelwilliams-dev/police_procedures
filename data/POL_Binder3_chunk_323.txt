to inequality in transportation access, the NYC government should expand the Fair Fares program to residents living at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, as the current 120% threshold still excludes some residents who cannot afford transit. This policy would make subways and non-express buses half-price for eligible residents, allowing them to access jobs to bring themselves out of poverty. Participants would apply for a special MetroCard, granting them half-price access to these services, and they would renew their eligibility annually to ensure they still meet the income requirements. The program would be funded using the NYC congestion tax on cars, set to provide $15 billion to the MTA from 2020-2024. Funding may also include federal government subsidies. The policy would be proposed through NYC Councilwoman Selvena Brooks- Powers, the Chair of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Policy Analysis The primary cost of expanding the Fair Fares program for low-income NYC residents would be the lost fare revenue from approximately 4.6 million NYC citizens who would no longer pay full fares.9,10 Assuming these individuals use the subway or bus twice daily over 262 workdays per year, this results in 2.41 billion rides annually.11 At the current fare of $2.90 per ride, this amounts to nearly $3.495 billion in lost revenue each year.12 Fares currently account for 23% of the MTAÕs $19.38 billion budget, making this a substantial financial loss.13 To compensate for these lost fares, the MTA could tap into funds from the recently raised NYC congestion tax, which is projected to provide $15 billion over 4 years to fund MTA expansion.14 This would eliminate the need for fare hikes, as using congestion tax funds would allow the $3.495 billion in lost fare revenue to be covered, given that the tax provides $3.75 billion in increased revenue per year to the MTA.14 This increased access to public transit for low-income individuals from Fair Fares would support upward economic mobility for low-income individuals. Limited public transit expansion has been correlated with higher rates of unemployment, meaning that increasing public transit access would decrease unemployment rates for low-income individuals.15 This decrease in unemployment rates would bring lower-income individuals closer to higher-income NYC residents, thereby increasing chances for upward economic mobility.15 There is also a positive relationship between transit access and the wealth of a neighborhood due to job access.15 Fare reduction programs for low-income residents have proven to be successful in other cities. The Boston city government implemented a 50% fare reduction program for low-income residents, projected to increase low-income ridership by 30%.16 Highlights  As of 2024, income inequality in the US is growing, with the top 10% of households holding 67% of the nationÕs wealth, while the bottom 50% holds only 2.5%.1  Access to public transportation has proven to be a powerful tool for reducing poverty, enabling individuals to reach job opportunities quickly and efficiently.5  Affordability remains a significant barrier, as approximately 30% of impoverished people struggle to afford public transportation.8  The city government
