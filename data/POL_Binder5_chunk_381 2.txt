12 hours prior to testing. Protective panels shall be laid flat at all times when conditioning and stacked in piles of no more than four panels. 6.4.2. Marking panels Protective panels shall be marked in accordance with the defined shot pattern for each protection level as specified in Table 10. Two asymmetric shot templates are available for each panel size, which can be inverted to give four potential shot patterns. Each pattern shall be used at least once during a test on a particular armour with the exception of formed panels where a fixed shot pattern shall be used. Where more than four panels are assessed, the shot pattern for the additional panels shall be selected at random. The shot pattern used on each panel shall be recorded and presented in the test report. In circumstances where it would be in contravention of shot placement rules (Table 7) to follow the template, the test facility shall identify another suitable location (e.g. on small panels where the shot template cannot be followed).

Figure 10 illustrates intended usage for the shot patterns. The centre point shall be identified as the intersection of the centrelines of the armour (from the widest sections) in horizontal and vertical directions. This point shall be used as the alignment position for all shot patterns. 22 Drawings available on request to CAST. Figure 10: Illustration of shot pattern intended usage In addition to the standard shot patterns, a further shot shall be positioned on all medium and large panels submitted for testing at a position 55 ± 5 mm from the edge of the panel, defined by the test facility (i.e. seven shots total shall be conducted on medium and large panels). No additional ÔedgeÕ shots are mandated for formed armour. 6.5. Unformed armour testing 6.5.1.
