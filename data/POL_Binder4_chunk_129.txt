five-point consensus â particularly its disregard for the ceasefire agreement, commitment to peaceful resolution, and worsening human rights abuses against the Rohingya people â ASEAN should suspend Myanmarâs membership.6 This suspension aligns with ASEANâs foundational principles of mutual respect, peaceful cooperation, and human rights and serves as a crucial step toward mitigating the conflict. To reinforce this stance, ASEAN should implement a region-wide arms embargo on Myanmar, with a clear mandate that member states who continue trading arms with Myanmar risk their own membership status. This coordinated approach would underscore ASEANâs commitment to upholding human rights and regional stability and exclude Myanmar from the crucial economic benefits of membership, pressuring the regime to reduce hostilities and align with ASEANâs standards of governance and peace. Policy Analysis ASEAN has mainly hesitated to expel Myanmar because doing so would eliminate crucial communication channels for diplomatic dialogue, humanitarian aid, and negotiation.10 However, these channels are failing to mitigate Myanmarâs violence: since ASEANâs five-point consensus, the military junta has killed at least 5,000 more Rohingya.11,12,13 ASEANâs current approach is ineffective and there is an urgent need for more drastic action. Removing Myanmar would deny it the economic benefits of ASEAN membership, weakening its military capacity. Southeast Asiaâs GDP is expected to grow at an annual rate of 5.1%, outpacing China, the US, and Europe.14,15,16 This is largely due to ASEAN initiatives, such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which enables tariff-free trade, protects investments, and secures market access among members.17 ASEAN has also invested $34 billion in research, sharing advancements among members through programs like the One-Shot Campaign, which provides vital vaccination, and invest in environmentally sustainable develepment.14 Myanmarâs exclusion would remove its access to these critical resources, pressuring the junta to change course. This approach aligns with historical precedent: Londonâs government cited South Africaâs forced withdrawal from the British Commonwealth during apartheid as pivotal in catalyzing global sanctions and isolation, essential for eventual change.18 Similarly, expelling Myanmar would signal that arms deals and economic ties with the junta are unacceptable. Removing Myanmar alongside a clear declaration of removal from the association for member states that partake in trade with Myanmar would affirm ASEANâs stance against human rights abuses and strain the juntaâs resources.8 Highlights: Since 1974, the Rohingya have faced brutal repression, peaking in 2017 when over 700,000 were forced to flee Bangladesh due to military- led violence.1 ASEANâs failure to effectively address Myanmarâs atrocities violates its core mission to uphold regional peace, stability, and adherence to international law.5 Myanmaeâs access to ASEANâs economic benefits, including tariff-free trade and regional investments, strengthens its regime and undermines ASEANâs credibility.17 ASEAN must suspend Myanmarâs membership and implement a region-wide arms embargo to underscore a commitment to human rights while pressuring Myanmarâs regime to reduce violence. Implementation The rotating ASEAN chair position provides significant influence over the associationâs agenda, with Malaysiaâs upcoming chairmanship in 2025 poised to play a pivotal role in advancing a more assertive stance on Myanmar.19 With increasing pressure for decisive action
