violence has led to more effective handling of cases, resulting in higher arrest rates and better enforcement of restraining orders.19 Additionally, such training enhances officers' ability to identify the primary aggressor in complex domestic violence situations, helping to reduce repeat offenses and prevent further harm.19 Practical, scenario-based training, including mock interviews and real-life simulations, has been shown to enhance police skills in managing domestic violence cases.19 This training equips officers to navigate the complexities of these situations, leading to higher prosecution rates and more accurate investigations. Incorporating trauma-informed approachesÑ which emphasize understanding and sensitivity toward survivorsÕ experiencesÑfurther improves interactions, reducing victim- blaming and increasing victimsÕ willingness to report abuse. A study by the National Policing Institute found that procedural justice training not only reduced crime but also improved public perceptions of the police, which is crucial for building trust with vulnerable populations.20 This model is essential for Kyrgyzstan, where interviews indicate that only about 10% of domestic violence cases are reported to the police via 102. Distrust in law enforcement, cultural stigma, and financial dependence often lead survivors to seek support elsewhere.21 By partnering with organizations like Bir Duino and utilizing resources from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Kyrgyzstan can lower the costs of developing and maintaining police training programs.22 These collaborations provide access to expertise, training materials, and funding that reduce the need for Kyrgyzstan to invest heavily in creating its own training infrastructure.23 Highlights  Since ratifying CEDAW in 1997, Kyrgyzstan has struggled to meet its obligations, with weak enforcement of domestic violence laws leaving victims unprotected and many cases dismissed.24  Kyrgyzstan should implement a mandatory, nationwide police training program to ensure accountability and improve protection and support for domestic violence victims.25  Addressing cultural and structural barriers, particularly in rural areas, is vital to building trust and encouraging reporting through sensitive, victim- centered approaches.26  Drawing from successful international models, Kyrgyzstan should adopt scenario-based and trauma- informed training to equip law enforcement with the skills needed for effective and compassionate interventions.27 Implementation While past legislation, such as the 2017 Law on Protection and Defense Against Domestic Violence, expanded protections on paper, its enforcement has been inadequate.28 Between January 2019 and April 2021, only 14% of reported cases reached the courts, with most dismissed due to ineffective intervention.29 This policy aims to close these gaps by introducing a comprehensive framework that prioritizes victim safety over reconciliation, addressing both structural and cultural barriers. To achieve this, amendments to the 2017 Law will be introduced through the Zhogorku Kenesh (Parliament of Kyrgyzstan) by partnering with progressive legislators and advocacy groups. Leveraging committees on human rights and gender equality, the policy will be framed as a measure aligning with KyrgyzstanÕs international obligations under CEDAW, emphasizing societal stability and the importance of addressing domestic violence as a public safety issue. This strategic framing will help navigate opposition rooted in traditional norms. Moreover, sustainable funding will be secured through government allocations and international grants, with support from organizations
