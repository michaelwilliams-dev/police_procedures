magistrates' court in England and Wales or Northern Ireland for an order setting aside the forfeiture of the cash or any part of it. The application must be made before the end of the period of 30 days starting with the day on which the period for objecting ended. But the court may give permission for an application to be made after the 30- day period has ended if it thinks that there are exceptional circumstances to explain why the applicantâ failed to object to the forfeiture within the period for objecting, and failed to make an application within the 30-day period. On an application under this section the court must consider whether the cash to which the application relates could be forfeited under section 298 (ignoring the forfeiture mentioned in subsection (1) above).

Where the court sets aside the forfeiture of any cashâ it must order the release of that cash, and that cash is to be treated as never having been forfeited. 297F Release of cash subject to forfeiture notice This section applies while any cash is detained under section 297C or 297D.
