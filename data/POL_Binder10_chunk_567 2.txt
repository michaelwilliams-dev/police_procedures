a crime scene, identify it and protect it.  Consider the forensic opportunities (including fingerprints, DNA, footprints and photography, body worn video) and if in doubt consult with a CSI.  Conduct house to house enquiries.  Ascertain the details of all witnesses.  Search the area for CCTV.  Consider area search, VIPER and street identification for the offender.  Consider if it is appropriate for an early arrest.  Take a detailed account from the victim and consider the provisions for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses.  Record detailed description of property where relevant.  Ensure that medical consent forms are signed if appropriate.  Provide victims, and any witnesses with information about Victim Support including the helpline 0808 168 9111 / 0808 281 0113 (local number)  Properly assess the incident. This includes assessing incidents to ensure that they do not form part of a Ôcourse of conductÕ as defined by the Protection from Harassment Act 1997  6.4 In all cases involving a crime, officers should obtain a Victim Personal Statement (VPS) on the first meeting with the victim should they wish to provide a VPS at the time.
