CRITICAL INCIDENTS and REPEAT VICTIMISATION 2.1 A Hate Incident or a Hate Crime has the potential to be or to become a Critical Incident and should be managed accordingly. This should be considered during the golden hour. 2.2 A Critical Incident is defined as ÔAny Incident where the effectiveness of the police response is likely to have a significant impact on the confidence of the victim, their family and/or their communityÕ. Further guidance is available in the publication: Critical Incident Management College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice. 2.3 Repeat Victimisation can be an issue for victims of Hate Incidents or Hate Crimes, and this would include both members of the public and police employees. The revised definition of repeat victimisation is: ÒWhen the same person or place / premises suffers from more than one incident within a rolling 12 month period or the caller self identifies that they are a repeat victim.Ó 2.4 Secondary Victimisation occurs when victims of Hate Crime or Hate Incidents experience indifference or rejection from the police, as this effectively victimises them for the second time. Secondary victimisation takes place whether or not in fact the Police show indifference or rejection; it is entirely down to how the victim perceives the interaction with the police. The onus rests entirely with the police to manage the interaction with the victim to ensure that they are left with no feelings of secondary victimisation. 2.5 Vulnerability. Victims of hate crime can often lead to being identified as being vulnerable. The revised definition of vulnerability in respect of crimes and incidents is: ÒA person is vulnerable / at risk if as a result of their situation or circumstances they are unable to protect themselves from harmÓÕ TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WELFARE Hate Crimes/Incidents within the Organisation Police employees who are victims of Hate Incidents or Hate Crimes will receive exactly the same high standard of service that they themselves are expected to deliver to members of the public.
