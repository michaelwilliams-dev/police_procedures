manage large-scale emergencies, and partners involved must have effective working relationships based on good communication, and effective, efficient information sharing. This will enable them to assess and agree who is best placed to address an issue. (see para 2.3) 16.12. DCLG RED plays an active part in increasing resilience: supporting preparedness enhancement and providing assurance to central government that the necessary capabilities are in place at the local level to meet national planning requirements. 16.13. Resilience Advisers within DCLG RED have been allocated liaison roles for each of the work streams in the National Resilience Capabilities Programme. RED will liaise with Lead Government Departments; LRFs and other relevant emergency responder organisations on current and planned LRF and multi-LRF capabilities. 16.14. REDÕs ability to engage with LRFs and, in particular, hold dialogue with multiple- LRFs, complements the existing governance and information sharing arrangements in place between work stream lead Departments and local responders. This is achieved by: o access and insights into the national capability requirements; o the ability to provide a richer picture of capabilities on the ground; and o facilitation and promotion of cross-boundary working between LRFs.

Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) can be impacted through several areas under Regulation and Legislation, and there are defined investigatory and recording requirements contained within those regulations and legislation. Where an incident is reported or recorded and starts the investigative process there can be a delay before any outcomes are known or lessons learnt being implemented. This can leave a residual risk for the team, department, or Wiltshire Police where other incidents that could have been prevented by the application of control measures can occur. The Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Incident Reporting and Management Procedure aims to receive and monitor Equality, Diversity and Inclusion incidents in order to understand the continuing risk, and provide recommendations and considerations as to how this can be mitigated in order to ensure Wiltshire Police meets its obligations.
