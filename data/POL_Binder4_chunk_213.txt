Detention of property pending section 127O appeal This section applies whereâ an application for an order under section 127M is made within the period mentioned in section 127J, and the application is refused. This section also applies whereâ an order is made under section 127M extending the period for which property may be detained under section 127J, and the order is discharged or varied so that detention of the property is no longer authorised by virtue of the order. The property may be detained until there is no further possibility of an appeal against the decision to refuse the application or discharge or vary the order (as the case may be). 127Q Release of property This section applies in relation to property whichâ has been seized by an appropriate officer under section 127C, and is detained under or by virtue of any of sections 127J to 127M and 127P. The property must be released if at any time an appropriate officer decides that the detention condition is no longer met. The detention condition is met for so long asâ any of the conditions in section 127B is met, and there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion mentioned in section 127C(1). Nothing in this section requires property to be released if there is a power to detain it otherwise than under or by virtue of sections 127J to 127M and 127P. Nothing in this section affects the operation of any power or duty to release property that arises apart from this section.
