Dual-Use Solar for New York: a Win-Win for Energy Development and Agriculture By Harrison Sachs, hls89@cornell.edu Establishing a dual-use solar policy for New York State will allow for the expansion of solar energy infrastructure needed to meet existing goals, promote the protection of agricultural land, and diversify farmerâs incomes. Background Dual-use solar also known as agrivoltaics is the practice of using the same land for solar energy and agricultural production. Solar grazing is the practice of raising livestock, mostly sheep on solar land. Policies are expanding solar and renewable energy, yet solar array sites need to be maintained through fossil fuels to run lawnmowers and the spraying of pesticides.1,2,3 By 2030, New York State must source 70% of its electricity through renewable sources and, by 2040, commit to a zero-emission electric grid per the 2019 New York Climate Act.1,4 In 2021, there were 2,113 farms in the state raising sheep, and as of January 1st 2024, there were 86,000 sheep in the state.2 Currently, contracting farmers with solar providers is challenging due to small herd sizes in the state; developers would rather talk with one entity that can represent several different farms rather than having to coordinate with many farms to manage solar sites.2 Additionally, solar panels for agricultural purposes have higher upfront costs for developers, which can discourage investment in agrivoltaics. In 2021, New York ranked second to last in average farm real-estate value per acre compared to other northeastern states.5 In 2013, the state established the New York Sun Act to expand solar energy in New York by offering incentives for installations, lowering energy costs, and creating jobs.6 However, New York State has no policies to specifically address or incentivize agrivoltaic production, despite the benefits and the regionâs high demand.
