To encourage specialists to return and increase their retention, the National Doctors Training and Planning Unit (NDTP) must coordinate outreach to update them on available consultant positions and healthcare system improvements. Background Ireland is in a âparadoxical situationâ involving medical students and healthcare workforce composition.1 Its numerus clausus policies allow unlimited international students to enter Irish medical schools, yet conflictingly provide little opportunity for their further clinical training.1 Consequently, the majority of these students leave after graduation.1 This loss, and the failure to retain medical graduates, classified as non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in later clinical training, contribute to Irelandâs reliance on foreign doctors.
