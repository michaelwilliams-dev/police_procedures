foreign doctors. Ireland thus produces ârelatively more medical graduatesâ than any other OECD country, yet recruits more âforeign- trained doctors than any other EU country.â1 This reliance contradicts its commitment to the World Health Organization Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, requiring the pursuit of âa sustainable health workforce.â2 For context, NCHDs emigrate at all training stages, but the loss of NCHDs at later stages creates a striking âbrain drainâ problem. In Ireland, physicians receive a Certificate of Satisfactory Completion of Specialist Training (CSCST) after specialist training following medical school. CSCSTs, besides general practitioners, typically complete subsequent fellowship training abroad.4 Traditionally, NCHDs temporarily emigrate to better advance in their career and then return to Ireland to work as consultants.1,4 Despite this historical âtemporary emigrationâ pattern among CSCSTs, some researchers worry that long-term emigration has increased.1 Although physicians are encouraged to gain specialty experience abroad, there are also negative factors driving their departure, including âstressful working conditionsâ with insufficient time allocated to training and a shortage of both âsuitable consultant postsâ and âcareer progression opportunities.â3 In particular, there are insufficient âpost-CSCST fellowships available in Irelandâ: in 2022, there were only 68 such fellowships but 452 CSCST graduates.4 In 2015, researchers found that doctors working abroad were interested in returning if âworking conditions in Irelandâ improved substantially.3 Policy Idea In their Annual Medical Retention Report 2023, the National Doctors Training and Planning unit (NDTP) of the Health Service Executive emphasized that there are âno formal structures to maintain contact with CSCSTs who leave Irelandâ and suggested âtargeted recruitment strategiesâ could encourage their return.4 The NDTP should create an international recruitment program for doctors who received CSCSTs in Ireland. The NDTP helps run the Doctors Integrated Management E-System (DIME) database, which records information about NCHDs working in the Irish public healthcare system and can be used to document when doctors âleave and return.â4 The NDTP should use the NCHD contact information stored in DIME to contact those who receive their CSCSTs in Ireland but are not actively registered with the Irish Medical Council (IMC) when (1) there are recruitment opportunities for consultants and (2) improvements are made in the Irish healthcare system to encourage their return and retention. Policy Analysis No similar policies are known to exist in other countries. Ireland has a unique culture of migration among those in their 20s, including doctors.1,4 Most specialties even âencourage trainees to migrate to achieve career progression.â4 Ireland requires culturally conscious policies, such as this recruitment program built around the migrational culture of CSCSTs. While the Irish government did not substantially implement previous policy reports proposing solutions to Irelandâs healthcare workforce issues, it is implementing the 2017 National Strategic Framework for Health and Social Care Workforce Planning (NSF).1 As the recruitment policy would fall under the ârevising recruitment strategiesâ objective of âpolicies to address inflows and outflowsâ outlined in the NSFâs Health Labour Market Framework, it would align with current workforce planning goals.2 For the 2016-2019 CSCST recipients, retention rates
