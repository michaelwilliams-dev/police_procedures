In relation to any complaint in respect of which the chief officer is the appropriate authority that is made on or after the day on which a notice under subsection (1) is givenâ the functions of the chief officer to which the notice relates become functions of the local policing body, references to the chief officer, including in the chief officer's capacity as an appropriate authority, in the provisions specified in subsection (2) or (as the case may be) subsections (2) and (3) are to be read as references to the local policing body, and for the purpose of paragraph 6(1) of Schedule 3, the complaint is to be treated as having been recorded by the chief officer. Where the notice under subsection (1) relates to the functions conferred on the chief officer by the provisions specified in subsections (2) and (3), subsection (4)(b) does not apply to the references to an appropriate authority in sections 20(2)(a) and (3A) and 21(7)(a) and (8A)(a).
