In this paragraph âthe relevant magistrates' courtâ meansâ a youth court acting in the relevant local justice area, if the offender is under the age of 18, or a magistrates' court (other than a youth court) acting in the relevant local justice area, if the offender is aged 18 or over. In sub-paragraph (4) âthe relevant local justice areaâ meansâ the local justice area for the time being specified in the order, or if the offender resides in another local justice area, that local justice area. (1) Where a court revokes an order under paragraph 5(2)(b), it may deal with the offender, for the offence in respect of which the order was made, in any way in which the court could deal with the offender if the offender had just been convicted by it of the offence (other than by making an order under section 1(2A)). In dealing with an offender under sub-paragraph (1), the court must take into account the extent to which the offender has complied with the order. A person sentenced under sub-paragraph (1) may appeal to the Crown Court against the sentence.

If the application is made by the offender, the relevant magistrates' court may amend the order by substituting the other local justice area for the area specified in the order.
