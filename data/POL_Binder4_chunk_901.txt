Types of domestic abuse To deliver an effective response, professionals and agencies should be aware of the different types of domestic abuse. Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance Intimate partner abuse Domestic abuse most commonly takes place in intimate partner relationships, including same sex relationships.15 Intimate relationships can take different forms, partners do not need to be married or in a civil partnership and abuse can occur between non- cohabiting intimate partners. As with all forms of abuse, abuse in intimate relationships can vary in severity and frequency, ranging from a one-off occurrence to a continued pattern of behaviour. Abuse can continue or intensify when a relationship has ended or is in the process of ending. This can be a very dangerous time for a victim including an increased risk to their physical safety. It is a highly critical period for ensuring support for victims, as they may consider returning to perpetrators during the period immediately after fleeing or ending the relationship. Separation can raise both the likelihood and consequences of risk because of the perpetratorâs perceived lack of control. Post-separation abuse may involve a range of abusive behaviour, see âChapter 3 â Recognising Domestic Abuseâ for further detail. It may be facilitated by technology and without effective intervention it can be ongoing and may escalate. In the year ending March 2021, 57 women and 10 men were recorded as being victims of homicide by a current or ex-partner.16 According to the Femicide Census, 38% of the women killed by their ex-partner or ex-spouse from 2009 to 2018 were killed within the first month of separation and 89% in the first year.17 18 Teenage relationship abuse
