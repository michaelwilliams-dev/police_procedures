[1] Reducing Recidivism Rates Through Mandatory Rehabilitation Programs By Pari Patel, pyp4@cornell.edu While prison rehabilitation programs have been proven to reduce recidivism rates, these programs are not compulsory for inmates and, therefore, mitigating the potential benefits the programs result in. Recidivism rates can be reduced by mandating participation in such programs. Background Recidivism refers to the rate at which released prisoners return to prison. The United States has an astonishingly high recidivism rate, with nearly 49.3% of federal offenders being rearrested over an eight-year period.1 Additionally, the stigma surrounding incarcerated individuals leaves released prisoners unable to secure employment and successfully rehabilitate into society, often leading them toward illicit activities.2 The high recidivism rate in the US is a consequence of its punitive rather than rehabilitation- based prison system.3 Prisoners are often stripped of their identity, lack a sense of community, and are exposed to an overly stressful and abhorrent environment that alters their mental health.4 Consequently, the lack of adequate social welfare support after incarceration can lead to incarceration.3 This vicious cycle of incarceration, release, and reoffense is compounded with racial and structural inequality. Black and Brown communities are more likely to be arrested due to stereotypes and unfair policing practices.5 This is further exacerbated by the generational discrimination and poverty minority communities face that add to the cycle structural inequality and incarceration.6 Furthermore, the annual cost of incarceration for one inmate costs American taxpayers around $120.59 per day, making recidivism not only a social issue but also an economic challenge.7 Beyond these direct costs, recidivism also has macroeconomic consequences. For instance, recidivism is cited to decrease the USÕs annual GDP by $65 billion a year due to the cost of housing inmates as well as the loss of productivity and tax revenue inmates would otherwise contribute to the economy.8 Additionally, this cost also does not include the economic and social cost incarceration has on families and communities.9 Reducing recidivism, therefore, is not just a criminal justice issue but also a critical economic and social priority. Policy Idea: To help reduce recidivism rates and support released inmates, state policymakers should implement a policy requiring inmates to participate in
