should target states that have been successful in the past with passing gun reforms, such as New York and California, to mandate firearm insurance statewide. While there are concerns about this policy not being able to adequately mitigate gun violence, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo explains that gun liability insurance will incentivize safety measures that will address gun deaths as a public health issue and from a harm reduction standpoint.18 Success at local and state levels would provide useful data on the policyâs effectiveness for federal policymakers who may be on the fence. Policy research centers and state government agencies could compare gun death rates in the state before and after implementation, which researchers could use to determine the effectiveness of these policies. As the US faces comparably high gun death statistics, it is more important than ever to implement creative solutions to combat gun deaths. Placing a share of the responsibility on the private sector would be an effective way to promote safe gun ownership and use.
