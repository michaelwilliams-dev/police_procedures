= 59). For the top ten retail addresses, the most demand is focused on the acquisitive personal crime (n = 475, 49.63%). Again, ÔotherÕ (n = 192) and nuisance (n = 166) incidents were also highly demanding for retail addresses accounting for 20.06% and 17.35% respectively. Within the top ten nightlife addresses, nuisance incidents required the highest demand (n = 208, 28.3%), accounting for an average of 21 incidents per address (see Table V). ÔOtherÕ incidents also account for a high volume of police resources (n = 200, 27.21%), followed by acquisitive (person) crime (n = 105, 14.29%) and violence against a person (n = 101, 13.74%). The highest demand within the top ten young peopleÕs services addresses was found to be welfare incidents (n = 231, 40.81%) (see Table V). In particular the top two addresses accounted for 176 of the 231 welfare incidents (76%). Both these addresses are childrenÕs homes which indicated a potential need for a more robust partnership plan for dealing with such addresses When comparing incident classifications across the five address categories it can be seen that welfare and nuisance incidents account for the highest number of coded incidents. In contrast, across all address categories, acquisitive (household) crime and sexual offences accounted for the least number of incidents, both of which are typically considered as traditional police business. When looking at the incident classifications collectively in terms of Ôtraditional police businessÕ and Ônon-traditional police businessÕ (removing the ÔotherÕ classification) traditional police incidents (acquisitive person and household crime, conditions, vandalism/criminal damage, violence against the person and sexual offences) accounted for 26.89% of incidents whereas non-traditional police incidents (disputes, nuisance, domestic incidents, and welfare) make up 44.78% of incidents. Time Frame Three time frames encompassed the largest demand: 11:01-14:00, 14:01-17:00 and 17:01- 20:00, therefore, with the exception of vandalism/criminal damage incidents, the period between 11:01 and 20:00 was found to be the most resource intensive (see Figure 1). [Figure 1: A chart showing the time frames for incident classifications across the top ten addresses for all categories] When looking at the five categories individually, a similar pattern can be seen. For residential addresses 17:01-20:00 and 20:01-23:00 were the most demanding time frames, for statutory bodies 11:01-14:00 and 14:01-17:00 required the most resources, for retail addresses 14:01- 17:00 and 17:01 Ð 20:00 required the most resources, and young peopleÕs services had a high demand within the time frame 11:01-14:00. Across these four address categories, the majority of incidents fall within one of the three resource intensive periods, with the only exception being the nightlife addresses which held its peak demand at 02:01-05:00 (see Figure 2). [Figure 2: A chart showing the mode time frames for incidents occurring for the 5 categories] Response Coding Across all address categories, the response code (see Table III) given the most was response code 3 (n = 1173, 29.27%) and the response code that was given the least was response code 1 (n = 276, 6.89%). This suggests that the majority of police
