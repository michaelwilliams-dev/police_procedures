measure aligning with KyrgyzstanÕs international obligations under CEDAW, emphasizing societal stability and the importance of addressing domestic violence as a public safety issue. This strategic framing will help navigate opposition rooted in traditional norms. Moreover, sustainable funding will be secured through government allocations and international grants, with support from organizations such as the UNDP, UNODC, and Bir Duino.30 Drawing on successful international models, this policy incorporates practices like MexicoÕs CRIMJUST program, which improved officersÕ skills by 28% and increased victim cooperation and trust in law enforcement.31 These approaches highlight the effectiveness of linking funding to measurable outcomes, such as higher victim reporting rates and more effective law enforcement responses. In Kyrgyzstan, where only 10% of domestic violence cases are reported due to fear of inaction, similar training programs could raise reporting rates and foster a supportive environment for survivors. 32, 33 Tailoring these strategies to KyrgyzstanÕs cultural and institutional context will help ensure practical implementation and long-term impact. The proposed training curriculum will emphasize trauma- informed, scenario-based learning, including mock interviews and real- life simulations to strengthen practical skills and empathy among officers.34 This approach has proven effective in the U.S., where a four- hour victim-support training led to a 32% increase in positive victim interactions and improved report accuracy.35 By equipping officers to handle cases sensitively, the policy seeks to reduce victim-blaming and encourage survivors to report abuse. Additionally, implementation will begin with pilot programs in urban and rural areas, allowing for iterative improvements before scaling nationwide. Beyond skill-building, the policy includes sustained engagement with local religious and community leaders to address cultural resistance, particularly in rural areas where family unity is often prioritized over victim safety.36 Recent initiatives provide a model for success: in August 2023, the UNDP and the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted field training as part of the SDG Partnership to address gender-based violence.37 Expanding this training nationally through a continuous program is essential to ensure lasting change. In essence, by establishing these practices as standard within law enforcement training, this policy would foster a sustainable, systemic response to gender-based violence across Kyrgyzstan, embedding trauma-informed, community- centered practices within the countryÕs policing framework.38, 39 Moving beyond temporary solutions, it aims to transform domestic violence response into lasting protection for survivors.
