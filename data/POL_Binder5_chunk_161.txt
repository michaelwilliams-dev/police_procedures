based on their own research and development through home loading. 12.86 Whilst there may be some small cost benefit, more often the reasons for home loading are the pursuit of accuracy, safety and performance. Where performance is involved; different quarry types and their physical makeup, the different ranges in which they are to be engaged (e.g. lighter or smaller flatter trajectory bullets for foxes and heavier bullets for deer) all vary, and home loaders may wish to experiment to ascertain the best combinations. It is not unusual for home loaders to manufacture two or three specific rounds in the same calibre for different species e.g. fox, small deer and large deer; this is to achieve a clean kill of more than one species without having to change firearms. 12.87 Home loaders will usually manufacture various batches for testing using a chronograph to measure velocity and thus ascertain the best combinations. Whilst a chronograph is important to home loaders; it is of utmost importance for ammunition intended for use on animals due to legislative requirements such as in the Deer Acts (see Chapter 13 for more information). 12.88 Whilst there are no limits imposed on the number of solid projectiles that a certificate holder may purchase for manufacturing ammunition, a home loader must not manufacture more than the maximum quantity of ammunition authorised by their firearm certificate. 12.89 Some reloaders may test ammunition by firing groups of 3 to 5 rounds, and repeat the group several times to measure consistency. As bullet designs, cases, primers and propellants are so varied, it is not unusual for home loaders to require larger amounts of missiles (bullets) for their research, and possess them in addition to any factory or other home loaded ammunition already held. Load development can be a long process, especially with unusual cartridges; particularly as new products become available. 12.90 Details of relevant explosives legislation governing the manufacture and storage of ammunition and shooters powders can be obtained in the first instance from the local force Explosive Liaison Officer (ELO) or from the Explosives Policy Team, Health & Safety Executive, 5S.G Redgrave Court, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside, L20 7HS. Quarry Shooting Note that the absence of a calibre in the table below should not preclude it being considered by the Police. The purpose of this table is as a guide to establish initial Ògood reasonÓ. Paragraphs 12.9 and 12.15 to 12.17 should be read in conjunction with this table. 113 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law Cartridges Muzzle energy (ft lb) Vermin & ground game and other small quarry3 Fox and other medium quarry4 Deer and other large quarry5 Dangerous Game6 .177-.25 Air Rifles (FAC)1 .22 RF .17 Mach 2 .17 HMR .22 WMR .17 Remington2 .22 Hornet2 .204 >12 ft lb 100-200 650-700 800-900 Yes No (Yes for .17 Remington & HMR, .22 Hornet and WMR Ð also .22 RF in certain circumstances (see paragraph 12.25)) No No .17 Remington2 .218 Bee .22 Hornet2 .22-.250 .220 Swift .222 Remington 5.56mm/.223 .243
