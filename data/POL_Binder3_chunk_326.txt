[1] EDUCATION POLICY Director: Sejal Sekhar Assistant Director: Danielle Berkowitz Analysts: Reagan Allvin, Jaiden Fisher-Dayn, Claudia Nesin, Ben Nusbaum, Abigail Silverman, and Sanshray Singh Eliminating Mandated Seniority-Based Teacher Layoffs in New York State to Ensure Educational Equity By Reagan Allvin, rra49@cornell.edu New York enforces a Òlast-in, first-outÓ policy by laying off new teachers first for firing public school teachers, threatening the careers of early-career educators and disrupting the classroom environment. Eliminating this mandate will maintain a diverse, supportive teacher workforce. Background Throughout the pandemic, states have spent a disproportionate amount of federal funds on hiring new teachers due to the influx of funding provided by the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER).1 One estimate records that 20% of ESSER funds were spent on staffing. Despite the current teacher shortage, economists predict a sharp increase in layoffs as ESSER spending is cut off in the upcoming years.2 Ideally, teacher layoffs would not be necessary, allowing for an environment of mentorship between new and experienced educators. However, just as emergency funding created budget space for new educators, its absence leaves teacher reduction as the most commonly predicted budget cut among district leaders3. In
