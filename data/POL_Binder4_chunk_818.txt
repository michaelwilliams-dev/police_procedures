The accreditation may specify that, in relation to that person, the application of sub- paragraph (3) is confined to one or more only (and not all) relevant byelaws, being in each case specified in the accreditation. Where that person has reason to believe that an individual has committed an offence against a relevant byelaw at a place within the relevant police area, he may exercise the power of an authorised officer of an authority to give a notice under section 237A of the Local Government Act 1972 [F1034or under section 12 of the Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Act 2012] (fixed penalty notices in relation to offences against certain byelaws). In this paragraph ârelevant byelawâ, in relation to an accredited person, means a byelaw whichâ falls within sub-paragraph (5); and is specified or described in that person's accreditation as a byelaw he has been accredited to enforce under this paragraph. A byelaw falls within this sub-paragraph ifâ it is a byelaw to which section 237A of the Local Government Act 1972 [F1035or to which section 12 of the Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Act 2012 applies] applies (fixed penalty notices in relation to offences against certain byelaws); and the chief officer of the police force for the relevant police area and the authority who made the byelaw have agreed to include it in a list of byelaws for the purposes of this sub-paragraph. A list under sub-paragraph (5)(b) must be published by the chief officer in such a way as to bring it to the attention of members of the public in localities where the byelaws in the list apply.
