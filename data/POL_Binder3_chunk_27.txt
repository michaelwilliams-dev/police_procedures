is unlikely to be successful without significant attention also being paid to external oversight and governance (Newburn 2015). External accountability mechanisms Ð human rights commissions, citizen complaint and review boards, police auditors Ð are widely heralded as important instruments of police accountability. Indeed, reform efforts are often limited and incomplete if undertaken without strong, independent external monitoring (Transparency International 2012). Quah (2007, 2017) recommends the establishment of an independent watchdog for the police, one that is independent from police and political control. Hong KongÕs ICAC is often considered highly effective. Scott (2017) suggests that the success of Hong KongÕs ICAC is due to the complex process of winning public trust, of ensuring certainty in outcomes, of establishing the authority of the commission in relation to other institutions and of monitoring anti-corruption systems. If this can be achieved, hostile exogenous factors may not easily disrupt long-established practices and may allow an ACA to retain or regain public support even in the face of serious scandals (Scott 2017). Hong KongÕs ICAC adopts a three-pronged approach to fighting corruption through enforcement, education and prevention. Public education is a crucial element of its three-pronged strategy to reduce corruption. Early efforts of the ICAC saw community liaison officers place special emphasis on publicising the arrest and successful prosecution of prominent police members. This helped establish the commissionÔs strong reputation for a determined crack-down on large scale corruption (Chne 2010). Large scale public education campaigns also enhance the legitimacy of the ICAC, promote the knowledge of anti- corruption laws, and mobilise the public to report corruption (Chne 2010). SingaporeÕs CPIB is also widely regarded as successful. It enjoys extensive legal powers. For example, CPIB officers can propose legislative reforms, seize passports, and freeze assets. They also have extensive powers to carry out their investigations such as the authority to arrest a person suspected of corruption and the ability to access a suspectÕs financial accounts or premises to search for evidence. However, like Hong KongÕs Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC), the CPIB has no power to prosecute directly (Transparency International 2012). Although deemed a successful measure against corruption, the CPIB produces no formal reports or quantifiable evidence to formally assess its success (Transparency International 2012). Further, some commentators highlight that the powers awarded to its officers risk potential abuses of authority (Transparency International 2012). 4. References Afrobarometer. 2018.
