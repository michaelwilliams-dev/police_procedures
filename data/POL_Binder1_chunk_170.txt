Because of the dispersion of impact points around the aim point, barbs that have been aimed at the frontal chest may present a hazard to sensitive structures in the head and neck regions, especially in children and adults of small stature. 49. There are four case reports (all from the U.S.) of ocular penetration by Taser barbs.26 Children and adults of small stature may be at higher risk of sustaining this type of injury because the eyes may be closer to the barb aim point. 50. Two case reports describe barb penetration of the skull (in one case entering the brain superficially).27 Age-related changes in skull thickness28 carry the implication that children may be at greater risk of brain injury from skull-penetrating barbs. 51. Pneumothorax from a Taser barb has been reported in a 16-year-old male.29 In general, the lesser body wall thickness of children30 may place them at greater risk of sustaining injuries to the lung and other organs (e.g. liver) from Taser barbs that have penetrated to their full depth. This injury mechanism would also apply to thin adults. Triggering of epileptic seizures 52. A case report describes an apparent generalised tonic-clonic seizure with loss of consciousness after a Taser shot in which one barb entered the skin at the back of the head while the other lodged in the upper back.31 53. DOMILL is aware of one incident in the UK involving use of the Taser in which an epileptic seizure occurred during the discharge (which was applied through barbs located in the region of the lower back). It was subsequently established that the person had an existing epilepsy disorder. 54. It is recognised that emotional stress, alcohol intoxication and physical exercise are among the seizure-precipitating factors reported by those with epilepsy.32 Poor compliance with anti- epileptic medication may further predispose to seizure induction during Taser deployment. Administration of Taser discharge to seemingly uncooperative and threatening persons 55. DOMILL is aware of an incident, widely reported in the press, in which UK police officers administered Taser discharge to an individual with epilepsy who had earlier collapsed, reportedly after experiencing Òa major epileptic seizureÓ.33 56. While not able to comment on this specific incident, DOMILL notes that aggressiveness can sometimes be a feature of the ictal and post-ictal states.34 Apparently intentionally threatening behaviour may not be under conscious control.34 26 See: Han, JS et al (2009).
