[1] Combatting the School-to-Prison Pipeline: Removing Police Presence from New York City Public Schools By Jaiden Fisher-Dayn, jf884@cornell.edu In order to address racial inequities in K-12 education and enhance school safety, NYC public schools should remove NYPD school safety officers and implement restorative justice measures. By removing officers, responses to student behavior will be in the hands of school counselors who can handle situations through methods and diversion programs that reintegrate students into class rather than suspensions and expulsion. Background Since the 1970s, United States K-12 public schools have increasingly used on-site full-time police officers, increasing from fewer than 100 to 20,000.1 While police presence aims to promote safety, increased policing only creates the illusion of security without addressing real issues.2 New York is one of just seven states where over 50% of schools have a police presence. As of late February 2023, the number of active New York City Police Department school safety agents totaled almost 3,900.3 In fact, research shows that school policing exacerbates inequity through disproportionate arrests of disabled, Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ students.4 From 2016 to 2020, 91% of all arrests at NYC schools are Black and Latinx young people, despite these students being only 66% of the enrolled population. Furthermore, the rise in school policing has come at the expense of other important school authorities. Almost one-third of American K-12 students attend schools with police presence, lacking sufficient nurses, counselors, or social workers.5 Instead of rehabilitative responses to misconduct, such as peer mediating or using dialogue to resolve conflicts, many schools have taken a retributive approach. These retributive policing approaches result in suspensions and other disciplinary actions that disproportionately affect children of color.5 On average, 250 preschoolers face suspension or expulsion each day.6 More broadly, nearly 3 million K-12 students endure suspensions, and over 100,000 get expelled every year.7 These disciplinary actions have harmed educational outcomes. They lead to academic struggles, increased dropout rates, and feed into the school-to-prison pipeline, in which young students from low- income backgrounds are more likely to be jailed due to punitive policies that push students out of the classroom.8 For instance, a study from the University of California, Irvine found that high school students who experience suspension or expulsion are more than twice as likely to face criminal charges as young adults.9 Policy Idea In order to address the issues of school policing,
