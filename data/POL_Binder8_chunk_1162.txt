Standard of proof For a breach hearing, the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.44 The applicant must therefore prove to the criminal standard of proof that the respondent has breached a term of their injunction. If the respondent denies they have breached a term of the injunction, the matter may be adjourned for witnesses to be called to give evidence. The applicant should be prepared to present clear and compelling evidence of the breach. 12.8. Remand The court has the power to remand a respondent in custody or on bail if, after that respondent has been arrested for suspected breach of an injunction (with or without warrant), the matter has not been resolved when the respondent is brought before the judge.45 The maximum time for remand in custody is eight days, unless the applicant and respondent both consent to a longer period. The applicant should be prepared to assist the court in coming to its decision and may be invited to make submissions as to whether a remand should be in custody or on bail. The court may also remand a respondent in custody or on bail if the court considers that a medical examination and report is required. If the respondent is remanded in custody for this purpose, the adjournment may not exceed three weeks at a time; if the person is remanded on bail, the adjournment may not exceed four weeks. The court has the power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 if it suspects the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder. Applicants should be prepared to assist the court if it has any concerns about the medical wellbeing of the respondent. 44 Paragraph 1.4 of Practice Direction to RSC Order
