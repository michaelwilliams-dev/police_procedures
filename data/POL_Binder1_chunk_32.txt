from each address during the year. Results / Findings The top ten statutory bodies have the most incidents calling for police service (30%) compared with the top ten in the other address categories. This is followed by those in the retail category (24%) and nightlife (18%), with young peopleÕs services and residential requiring the least resources (14% of the total each). Incident Classification The majority of all reported incidents fell under the classification of ÔotherÕ (n = 1136, 28.35%) (see Table IV). For the coded classifications, the biggest demand was from welfare (n = 756, 18.87%), nuisance (n = 734, 18.32%), and acquisitive person crime (n = 667, 16.65%). [Table IV. Incident classification for all categories profiled] Most of the top ten residential addresses were found to associate with one specific incident classification. When exploring the residential demand (see Table V), welfare incidents accounted for the highest number of the reported incidents (n = 210, 37.91%). However, this was skewed by four addresses that accounted for 89.5% of the incidents. This suggests that welfare is a distinct problem area for some particular households, but that nuisance is causing problems across a wider amount of addresses. [Table V. Incident classification for individual address categories] Incidents classified as ÔotherÕ were found to be the biggest call for services in statutory bodies (n = 565, 47.28%), and the largest coded incident classifications were welfare (n = 245, 20.5%) and nuisance (n = 178, 14.9%) (see Table V). However, this is skewed by the inclusion of a central hospital which generated a large number of welfare incidents. If this address is removed, statutory bodies accrue a larger amount nuisance incidents (n = 104, 20.47%) and ÔotherÕ incidents (n = 234, 46.06%). Despite this, welfare is still the third highest demand intensive classification accounting for 11.61% of the incidents (n = 59). For the top ten retail addresses, the most demand is focused on the acquisitive personal crime (n = 475, 49.63%). Again, ÔotherÕ (n = 192) and nuisance (n = 166) incidents were also highly demanding for retail addresses accounting for 20.06% and 17.35% respectively. Within the top ten nightlife addresses, nuisance incidents required the highest demand (n = 208, 28.3%), accounting for an average of 21 incidents per address (see Table V). ÔOtherÕ incidents also account for a high volume of police resources (n = 200, 27.21%), followed by acquisitive (person) crime (n = 105, 14.29%) and violence against a person (n = 101, 13.74%). The highest demand within the top ten young peopleÕs services addresses was found to be welfare incidents (n = 231, 40.81%) (see Table V). In particular the top two addresses accounted for 176 of the 231 welfare incidents (76%). Both these addresses are childrenÕs homes which indicated a potential need for a more robust partnership plan for dealing with such addresses When comparing incident classifications across the five address categories it can be seen that welfare and nuisance incidents account for the highest number of coded incidents.
