We should therefore strengthen existing partnerships with other like-minded countries, such as France and Canada as well as consider carefully how to increase bilateral cooperation with countries like the US and China, such as through the recent declaration signed with the US to increase collaboration on AI R&D,30 to enable effective strategic action to shape a global AI landscape. One immediate way forward is to leverage our founding membership in the Global Partnership for AI (GPAI), a scalable club of like-minded governments ready to be led by experts on tackling the most pressing priorities for collaboration, where the UK is already leading on data governance.31 The UK has a pivotal opportunity to play an influential role in the coming year as it adopts the Presidency of the G7 and the 26th UN Climate Change conference.

Advancements in AI products and services underpin the capacity to compete economically but is also the domain of contests between overseas power bases and other nation states, which are sometimes not well aligned to the UK interest. One way to respond to this shift in geopolitical context is to invest strategically in research, development and innovation, choosing areas of national strengths such as AI and supporting them heavily with the aim of becoming globally competitive. If we align this strategic investment with the construction of broad coalitions of interest on the global stage, the UK can increase our sovereign capabilities and attract researchers and technologists with the skills to develop leading products in a number of competitive sectors.
