Program (CRCCP) should implement a policy to enhance CRC screenings by administering self-service kiosks that distribute at-home stool-based Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) kits to residents in the recommended age range of 45 to 75.9 These kiosks should be placed in high-traffic, non-clinical settings to optimize accessibility for minority populations. The FIT kits should be culturally tailored towards those minority groups, containing instructions and educational materials to address language barriers, discomfort, and any negative perceptions towards screenings. Along with these materials, a return envelope should be provided to mail the FIT kit to its respective testing site with a follow- up process for individuals that test positive to receive a colonoscopy. In accordance with these kiosks, community outreach groups will be constructed to advise how to improve distribution and other aspects of the screening process. Policy Analysis A policy implementing self- service kiosks that distribute FIT kits would require commitments from the CRCCP, community outreach groups, and participants. Placing automated kiosks in high- traffic areas would be practical and can be modeled on the administration of prior self-service COVID-19 and Influenza testing kiosks.10,11 This innovative approach to CRC screening increases convenience for residents and does not require access to health insurance or a primary care provider. Automated kiosks can be applied to various public health initiatives, such as screenings for HIV, to provide more equitable access to minority populations.12 At-home stool-based tests serve as viable substitutes to conventional screening methods in both their efficacy and distribution. The FIT kit is a unique method of screening that tests for occult blood in the stool with an overall 95% accuracy.13 Pilot trials conducted by the National Cancer Institute have shown improved completion of CRC screenings by distributing FIT kits through a mailing process, finding higher and quicker response rates with FIT kit outreach compared to colonoscopy distribution.14 Other private or state- level initiatives present a pragmatic approach to distributing low-cost testing kits, including FIT implementation guides that demonstrate the feasibility of their use and return.15,16 In addition, the FIT kit is a noninvasive alternative to colonoscopies that is currently underutilized among all populations.17 The community outreach program associated with the screenings will help ensure that the distribution methods are culturally competent, inclusive, and accessible to minority populations. A study that implemented a culturally tailored navigator intervention program found increased screening rates led by multilingual navigators that educated patients on CRC, addressed barriers to screening, translated information, and organized appointments.18 Using a hands-on approach to understand the perceptions and accommodate for the individual circumstances of participating community residents can enhance overall screening outcomes.19 Highlights Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths; however, the rates of diagnoses and mortalities are substantially amplified for minority populations.1,2 CRC is one of the most preventable cancers through adequate early screenings.4 However, typical screening methods, such as colonoscopies, are invasive and lower quality for minority individuals and lead to reduced screening participation among these groups.5,6 To address disparities in CRC treatment, the Centers for Disease Control
