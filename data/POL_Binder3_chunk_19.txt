as the conduct of investigations and arrestsÓ (Chne 2010). However, cultural considerations must be taken into account in any study of police corruption. Police officers are often confronted with morally ambiguous dilemmas in the course of their work and, as discussed briefly below, corruption in the police can take many forms and occur in many situations across many different cultures. This moral ambiguity is exemplified by the dilemma of Ònoble cause corruptionÓ. Police are agents of the state and are bound by strict policies and procedures. On the other hand, they are morally committed to the Ògood endÓ (Crank, Flaherty & Giacomazzi 2007). These roles can be conflicting because the policies and procedures in place to protect officers and the public can obstruct an officer from obtaining this good end (Caldero & Crank 2011). Noble cause corruption therefore occurs when a person tries to produce a just outcome through unjust methods, for example, police manipulating evidence to ensure a conviction of a known offender (Merrington et al 2014) Pyman (2012) argues that it is more pragmatic to accept a broad definition that permits further, healthy discussion. Further discussion on the definition of police corruption can be found in Arresting Corruption in the Police: The Global Experience of Police Corruption Reform Efforts. Types of police corruption Corruption in the police ranges from petty corruption and small acts of bribery to criminal infiltration and political corruption (Chne 2010). Several reports provide a more in-depth discussion of the different types of police corruption (see, for example, USAID 2007; DCAF 2012; Transparency International 2012; Council of Europe 2015). However, police corruption is generally categorised into four types:  Petty corruption among lower level police officers includes acts of bribery in everyday interactions with citizens (for example, by traffic police). According to Transparency InternationalÕs Global Corruption Barometer, the police is the institution most often reported as being the recipient of bribes (Pyman et al 2012). For example, in the Middle East and North Africa, one in four people who dealt with police paid a bribe (Transparency International 2016).  Bureaucratic corruption or administrative corruption refers to the misuse of internal procedures and administrative processes and resources for private gain, such as licensing or a lack of response to citizenÕs complaints against police officers.  Corruption linked with criminal groups includes misconduct such as misleading investigations or tampering with evidence.  High level or political corruption occurs where high level police officials abuse their power for personal gain or for the benefit of political groups to which they are formally or informally affiliated Ð in other words, criminal infiltration of the state. Political interference may also occur in police investigations, false investigations and the ÒframingÓ of political opponents. The impact of police corruption The impact of corruption in the police can be far reaching. When basic functions of law and order are compromised by corrupt practices within a police force, the state cannot legitimately prevent and punish violations of the law or protect human rights (Pyman
