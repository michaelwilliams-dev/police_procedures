new recording media. Care should be taken, particularly when a number of sets of recording media have been used, to ensure that there is no confusion between them. This may be done by marking the recording media with an identification number immediately after they are removed from the recorder. Taking a break during interview 229. When a break is to be taken during the course of an interview and the interview room is to be vacated by the interviewee, the fact that a break is to be taken, the reason for it and the time should be recorded on the recording media. The recording media should then be removed from the recorder and the procedure for the conclusion of an interview as set out in paragraph 234 below followed. 230. When a break is to be a short one and both the interviewee and the person conducting the interview are to remain in the interview room, the fact that a break is to be taken, the reasons for it and the time should be recorded on the recording media.
