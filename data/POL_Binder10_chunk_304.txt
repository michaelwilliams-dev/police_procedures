than with cause or source. Therefore, an emergency inside or outside the UK is covered by the definition, provided it has consequences inside the UK. 5 12.16. An emergency is considered to have consequences inside the UK if the serious damage is within the territorial sea of the UK.6 The territorial sea is the area of sea up to 12 nautical miles to seaward of the UK coast (or, more accurately, to seaward of the coastal baseline established by statute). 2 s. 2(3). See also s. 4 and s. 6 3 s. 3(3), s. 4(8) and 6(6) 4 s. 1 5 s. 1(5) 6 s. 18(2) 12.17. 12.18. A place in the UK may be anything from a small village to a town square to a large city. It may also include a part of a region or an entire region. Determination of when an emergency has occurred, or is likely to occur, is addressed in three ways. The Act provides: o a specification of the kinds of event or situation which may cause ÒdamageÓ; 7 and o two tests for determining whether an event or situation threatening 8 such damage constitutes an emergency (one of which must be met). o The Regulations outline: The common procedures that Category 1 responders must follow in making the decision to activate a business continuity or emergency plan. 9 Damage 12.19. The Act sets out a list of events or situations which may be considered to pose a threat of damage to human welfare, the environment or security.10 Two tests as to whether a response is required 12.20. A Category 1 responder must perform its duties under the Act only in relation to two situations, either of which poses a considerable test for that organisationÕs ability to perform its functions.11 7 s. 1(1)-(3) 8 s. 2(2)(a)-(b) 9 regulation 24 10 s. 1(2)-(3) 11 s. 2(2) PAGE 7 12.21. The two tests are: o where the emergency would be likely to seriously obstruct its ability to perform its functions;12 o where the Category 1 responder: o would consider it necessary or desirable to act to prevent, reduce, control, or mitigate the emergencyÕs effects, or otherwise take action; and o would be unable to act without changing the deployment of its resources or acquiring additional resources.13 One of these two tests must be met for the main duties of the Act to apply. Procedure for determining when an emergency has occurred 12.22. A procedure for determining when an emergency has occurred must be written into business continuity and emergency plans. The procedure should enable the person who will make the judgment to be identified, and state how they will be advised and 1.1. whom they must inform.14 The person will usually be a post-holder identified by their role or job title. More information on this can be found in Chapter 5 Ð Emergency Planning. It is particularly important that this is clearly stated in multi-agency plans.
