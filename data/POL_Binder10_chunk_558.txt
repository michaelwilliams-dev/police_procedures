We are dedicated to the prevention and detection of crime and disorder and the protection of vulnerable individuals, families and communities. As part of this promise we will robustly pursue those responsible for committing or inciting Hate Crime as well as tackle the causes of the prejudice with our partners. We will conduct all investigations with professionalism, respect, integrity and transparency. To ensure the highest possible standards are maintained, Wiltshire Police will create an environment where staff fully understand the concept of Hate Crime, its ramifications for the community, and how best to tackle it. People that work for our organization should never have to suffer Hate Crime, and we will ensure that where our staff are subjected to it that we treat it with the utmost seriousness, just as we would in the public space. Our staff will be aware of the support available to them where they are subjected to it. POLICY AIM The
