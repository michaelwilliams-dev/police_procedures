in exceptional circumstances, where the birds are causing serious crop damage, a Notice may be served under section 98 of the Agriculture Act 1947. 13.50 In England and Wales it is also an offence to kill or take game on a Sunday or Christmas Day during the open season. Scotland 13.51 Dates when game birds may be shot, taken or killed are as follows, taken from section 2(4) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended by the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011. Note that section 2 of the1981 Act applies, as per section 74, and that all dates are inclusive: Pheasant 1 October Ð 1 February Partridge 1 September Ð 1 February 127 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law Black grouse (heathfowl) 20th August to 10th December Red grouse (muirfowl) 12th August to 10th December Ptarmigan 12th August to 10th December 13.52 Note: Section 2(1) of the 1981 Act states that a person will not be guilty of an offence of killing, taking, or injuring a bird outside of close season if the person who kills, injures or takes the bird has a legal right or permission to do so. However section 2(3) states that on Sundays and Christmas day section 2(1) shall not apply in Scotland or in any area of England and Wales which the Secretary of State may by order prescribe (see paragraph 13.43 above). Therefore, in the open season it is an offence to kill, take or injure a bird on a Sunday or on Christmas day in one of those areas, regardless of whether the individual would otherwise have a legal right or permission to do so. 13.53 Capercaillie are now a protected species in Scotland due to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (Amendment) (Scotland) Regulations 2001. Ground Game England and Wales 13.54 In England and Wales ground game (hares and rabbits) have no close seasons, therefore people with shooting rights can shoot ground game all year. In addition, the Ground Game Act 1880 gives an occupier, or one other person authorised in writing by them, a concurrent right to shoot ground game on the land they occupy regardless of whether they hold the shooting rights on that land or not. However, on moorland and unenclosed land the right given to occupiers to shoot ground game is restricted to the period running from 11 December to 31 March inclusive. An occupier can only authorise persons who are: i. members of their household, resident on the land in his occupation ii. persons in their ordinary service (i.e. an employee) on such land, and; iii. any other person employed by them for reward in the destruction of ground game. 13.55 Under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (schedule 4), Blue (mountain) hares cannot lawfully be shot with automatic or semi-automatic weapons with a magazine capable of holding more than two rounds of ammunition. Under the Game Act 1831, hares cannot be shot on a Sunday or Christmas Day. Scotland 13.56 On
