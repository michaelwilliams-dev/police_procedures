Note: Appointed persons who are not first aid trained should not be confused with the appointed level of first aid training provided to police officers, special constables, pcsoÕs and specialist police staff. First Aid Provision Risk Assessment The health and safety department carry out an annual full first aid provision risk assessment for all Wiltshire Police workplaces. This is to ensure first aid provision in respect of numbers of first aiders, equipment and facilities is appropriate to the circumstances of each workplace and meets legal requirements. The majority of Wiltshire PoliceÕs first aid needs will be satisfied by the COP Module 2 First Aid Police Skills which is equivalent to the National EFAW Course. Module 2 is delivered to all police officers and identified police staff. However some buildings because of their higher occupancy levels will require additional staff to be trained to FAW (First Aid at Work) level at Appendix 1. Where the first aid risk assessment identifies a need, suitable numbers of first aiders will be provided to enable first aid to be administered without delay should the occasion arise. Increased provision may be required to cover annual leave, sickness, shifts etc. Where the assessment identifies that a first aider is not required, an appointed person will be nominated to take charge of the first aid arrangements including looking after the first aid container and facilities. Refer to Table 1 below for details of the Health and Safety Executive suggested numbers of first aid personnel required to be available at all times people are at work. This guidance will be followed when carrying out the annual first aid risk assessments.
