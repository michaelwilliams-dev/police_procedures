For victims who suffer physical health issues, injuries can include bruises and welts, lacerations and abrasions, abdominal or thoracic injuries; fractures and broken bones or teeth; sight and hearing damage and head injuries.63 Victims can be seriously physically injured as a result of domestic abuse and experience long-term injuries. Victims may suffer from functional disorders or stress-related conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal symptoms, fibromyalgia, chronic pain syndromes and exacerbation of asthma. Psychological harms can be associated with poorer physical health and this can include psychosomatic symptoms such as numbness and thrombosis, shaking and nervous twitching, cramps and paralysis.64 Psychological Not all domestic abuse begins with or results in physical abuse. Domestic abuse and associated trauma can have a significant impact on a victimâs emotional, psychological and mental wellbeing. This may involve feelings of isolation, worthlessness and dependency on the perpetrator.

Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance A victimâs day to day life can be affected by trying to manage the abuse, leading to increased anxiety and a focus on adapting their behaviour to appease the perpetrator. This can subsequently lead to a victim adopting the perspective of the perpetrator and starting to blame themselves for the abuse67 and may result in the victim questioning or doubting their own experiences and developing low self-esteem.68 See also the âMental healthâ section in âChapter 5 â Different experiences, needs and related considerationsâ.
