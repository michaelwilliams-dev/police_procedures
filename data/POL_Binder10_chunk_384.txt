Health  Significant number of people in affected area impacted with multiple fatalities, multiple serious or extensive injuries, significant hospitalisation and activation of MAJAX procedures across a number of hospitals Social  Significant damage that requires support for local responders with external resources  100 to 500 people in danger and displaced for longer than 1 week. Local responders require external resources to deliver personal support  Significant impact on, and possible breakdown of, delivery of some local community services Economic  Significant impact on local economy with medium-term loss of production  Significant extra clean-up and recovery costs Environment  Significant impact on environment with medium-to long-term effects 5 Catastrophic Health  Very large numbers of people in affected area(s) impacted with significant numbers of fatalities, large number of people requiring hospitalisation with serious injuries with longer-term effects Social  Extensive damage to properties and built up environment in affected area requiring major demolition  General and widespread displacement of more than 500 people for prolonged duration and extensive personal support required  Serious damage to infrastructure causing significant disruption to, or loss of, key services for prolonged period. Community unable to function without significant support Economic  Serious impact on local and regional economy with some long-term, potentially permanent, loss of production with some structural change  Extensive cleanup and recovery costs. Environment  Serious long term impact on environment and/or permanent damage PAGE 58 Emergency Preparedness | Annex 4 D: Likelihood and impact scoring scales Category Explanation Health Encompassing direct health impacts (numbers of people affected, fatalities, injuries, human illness or injury, health damage) and indirect health impacts that arose because of strain on the health service Social Encompassing the social consequences of an event, including availability of social welfare provision; disruption of facilities for transport; damage to property; disruption of a supply money, food, water, energy or fuel; disruption of an electronic or other system of communication; homelessness, evacuation and avoidance behaviour; and public disorder due to anger, fear, and/or lack of trust in the authorities Economic Encompassing the net economic cost, including both direct (e.g. loss of goods, buildings, infrastructure) and indirect (e.g. loss of business, increased demand for public services) costs Environment Encompassing contamination or pollution of land, water, or air, with harmful biological/chemical/radioactive matter or oil, flooding, or disruption or destruction of plant or animal life Note Strictly, levels 1 and 2 of the impact scale are likely to fall below threshold for an emergency. Consequently, there may be no statutory requirement to plan for events that score 1 or 2 on the impact scale. This scale recognises that, to demonstrate a thorough analysis, Category 1 responders will wish to include in the risk assessment certain risks with impacts at these levels.
