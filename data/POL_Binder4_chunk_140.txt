Healthcare Policy Director: Kaitlyn Z Varriale Assistant Director: ZoÃ« OâHalloran Analysts: Arjun Anugole, Tanirika Choudhry, and Kimia Shahriyar Care for Colorectal Cancer: Establishing Self- Service FIT Kiosks to Diminish Racial Inequities By Arjun Anugole, aa2823@cornell.edu The rates of colorectal cancer are considerably disproportionate for minority populations compared to their white counterparts. To address this disparity, the federal government should implement a policy establishing self-service testing kiosks as an effective alternative to traditional screenings. Background In 2020, the World Health Organization reported that there were approximately 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) and over 930,000 resulting deaths, making it the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortalities in the world.1 However, for minority populations in the US, this number is significantly greater. African Americans have a 20% higher incidence and a 40% higher mortality rate for CRC compared to other racial groups.2 This inequality can be attributed to structural barriers, including mistrust, maltreatment, and the lack of access to health insurance or a primary care provider.3 Despite its alarming prevalence in the US, CRC is among one of the most preventable cancers through proper screenings and early detection.4 The most common screening modality is a colonoscopy; however, these methods tend to be invasive and lower quality for minority individuals.5,6 Mistreatment and biases inflicted on by physicians contribute to inferior screenings coupled with discomfort, lack of social support, cultural norms, and socioeconomic factors that notably enhance the reluctance of minorities to participate in CRC screenings.5 The negative perceptions and lack of education on CRC screenings form a glaring racial disparity that needs to be addressed by establishing comfortability and different screening methods. The advent of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 served to increase CRC screening rates, yet Hispanic, African American, and Native populations remain disproportionately underserved.7 With minimal movement aimed at improving overall CRC screening rates, there has been even less implemented legislation for minority groups.8 To improve CRC- related outcomes among minority populations, different screening approaches need to be put in place to overcome the systemic obstacles minorities face. Policy Idea To address the disparities in CRC treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) should implement a policy to enhance CRC screenings by administering self-service kiosks that distribute at-home stool-based Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) kits to residents in the recommended age range of 45 to 75.9 These kiosks should be placed in high-traffic, non-clinical settings to optimize accessibility for minority populations.
