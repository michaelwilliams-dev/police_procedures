Incarcerated individuals rely on their wages to support their families and have limited financial ability to do so with an average hourly wage between $0.10 and $0.33.3 Studies show a clear link between financial stability and reduced recidivism rates, with Norwayâs implementation of fair wages for incarcerated individuals resulting in one of the lowest global recidivism rates.15 Implementing a pre-release earnings program will provide incarcerated individuals with living wages and a financial safety net following their release. Such economic stability would lead to successful reintegration and decreased recidivism. Implementation Successfully implementing a pre-release earnings program in NYS requires collaboration with the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), the American Correctional Association (ACA), and a shift in funding. DOCCS should play a central role in structuring, implementing, and monitoring the program.16 First, DOCCS would need to work closely with policymakers to establish fair wage standards by categorizing industry and non- industry jobs. They should specify eligibility criteria, limiting the program to those incarcerated for non-violent crimes and who have been granted parole.17 This criterion ensures focus on individuals statistically less likely to reoffend, making the program safer and more justifiable in the eyes of the public. Second, DOCCS should establish an efficient payroll system that is integrated into NYSâs correctional system and should coordinate with third-party labor agencies to conduct periodic inspections, ensuring wage disbursement accuracy and policy compliance. Additionally, collaboration with the ACA, a professional organization aiming to improve the justice system, and the NYS Department of Labor would align inmate work policies with industry standards, standardizing practices across facilities.18,19 The proposed program requires investing in inmate livable wages through reallocations within the $3.02 billion state correctional budget.20 This investment could prove to be controversial. Yet, by reallocating resources and exploring federal grants, the stateâs budget would not be immensely burdened. Such resources would come from less essential, non-rehabilitative administrative functions and such grants would be those aimed at reducing recidivism like those provided by the Second Chance Act.21 Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the 16,300 non-violent criminals in NYS will be granted parole and paid $15 an hour for 30 hours of weekly work.21 Given that they work for an average of two months before their release, the programâs cost ranges from $12.62 million to $18.92 million, representing only .42 percent to .63 percent of the NYSâs current correctional budget.20,22 Introducing the proposed program as law would require support from key lawmakers on criminal justice, labor, and budgeting committees. Such support could be gained by highlighting the potential to reduce the stateâs $3 billion correctional budget through lower recidivism rates and improved post-release employment. Presenting concrete data on the success of pre-release programs in other countries, such as Norway, where the recidivism rate sits at 20%, along with testimonies from stakeholders would make a compelling case for the program.15 In the initial years following the programâs implementation, its success should be monitored, by the DOCCS and independent research organizations, to identify any necessary adjustments.
