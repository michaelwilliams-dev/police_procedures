Conversely, above- specification output parameters may directly increase the risk of occurrence of a medical adverse outcome. DOMILL therefore recommends that consideration should be given to the design and implementation of a nationwide quality control programme, with clear guidelines on the management of Tasers found to be out-of-specification. This may become increasingly important as the age of deployable Tasers in the UK increases. 90. DOMILL welcomes this opportunity to examine the issues associated with use of the Taser less- lethal system on children and vulnerable adults. Whilst recognising that training is already given to police officers on interacting with people having many of the conditions considered in this document, DOMILL recommends that a review of the ACPO Guidance on Operational Use of Taser is undertaken to ensure that the correct lessons are identified for the training of personnel and the deployment of the Taser system in the UK. 91. DOMILL recommends that CAST5 continues to notify the Committee in a timely fashion of any adverse events associated with operational use of the Taser system in the UK. DOMILL also recommends that CAST continues to compile annual Taser use reports for subsequent review by the Committee.
