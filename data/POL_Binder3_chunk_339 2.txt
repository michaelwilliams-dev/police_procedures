provider closure Ñ just 5% of providers who received funding closed during the pandemic, as opposed to 26% of providers who did not.17 This illustrates that the loss of FCC providers is rooted in inadequate funding, rather than disinterest in the field. For underappreciated childcare providers, particularly those responsible for FCC, this mixed-delivery model would denote them as a legitimate facet of the childcare team. It would enable them to maintain financial viability by preventing the loss of profitable three- and four-year-old children, preserving the jobs of a group disproportionately composed of racial and ethnic minority women.18 Highlights  The implementation of public pre-K programs nationwide is putting private childcare providers out of business, exacerbating the lack of availability and affordability within the childcare market.4  To resolve this issue, public pre-K should be subsidized through mixed-delivery systems, which fund preschool programs in many settings, including public schools, center-based care, Head Start programs, religious centers, and family or home-based childcare.11  Mixed-delivery systems provide parents with the agency to choose between a range of preschool options, enabling access to high- quality, local, culturally and linguistically appropriate care, available during non- traditional hours.16  A mixed-delivery pre-K system is feasible due to bipartisan support, successful examples across the nation, and its efficient use of pre-existing childcare infrastructure.20, 21, 6 Implementation Due to high bipartisan support for the measure, the implementation of mixed-delivery funding for subsidized pre-K is very feasible.19 This ability to generate bipartisan support was exemplified during the 2024 vice presidential debate, in which both candidates supported a mixed-delivery system in order to strengthen parent choice in childcare.20 Additionally, as mixed-delivery pre-K utilizes pre- existing infrastructure, implementation is time- and cost- efficient.6 When implementing a mixed-delivery model, states should look to the models provided by previously established systems. Successful examples of mixed- delivery include WashingtonÕs Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, North CarolinaÕs Smart Start Network, and West VirginiaÕs WV pre-K.21 The methods adopted by these states vary, and those considering implementation should determine which model would work best for them by performing a comparative analysis of their demographics, political ideologies, and the availability of funding as compared to example states. Next, states should develop a clear and comprehensive legislative framework defining their mixed- delivery model, outlining eligibility criteria, funding mechanisms, and quality standards. States should ensure that both center- and home- based childcare providers are eligible for funding, ensuring the financial viability of FCC providers. As subsidization is chronically underutilized by FCC providers even when technically available, states should develop a mechanism for clearly communicating the funding opportunities available to these providers, and create a program to help assist them with the paperwork necessary for participating. Once the mixed- delivery model is established, the state should put a robust monitoring and evaluation system in place to assess the systemÕs effectiveness and address any issues that may materialize. This system ought to measure and analyze enrollment numbers, child outcomes, and provider and family satisfaction, enabling the state to make adjustments
