US, this number is significantly greater. African Americans have a 20% higher incidence and a 40% higher mortality rate for CRC compared to other racial groups.2 This inequality can be attributed to structural barriers, including mistrust, maltreatment, and the lack of access to health insurance or a primary care provider.3 Despite its alarming prevalence in the US, CRC is among one of the most preventable cancers through proper screenings and early detection.4 The most common screening modality is a colonoscopy; however, these methods tend to be invasive and lower quality for minority individuals.5,6 Mistreatment and biases inflicted on by physicians contribute to inferior screenings coupled with discomfort, lack of social support, cultural norms, and socioeconomic factors that notably enhance the reluctance of minorities to participate in CRC screenings.5 The negative perceptions and lack of education on CRC screenings form a glaring racial disparity that needs to be addressed by establishing comfortability and different screening methods. The advent of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 served to increase CRC screening rates, yet Hispanic, African American, and Native populations remain disproportionately underserved.7 With minimal movement aimed at improving overall CRC screening rates, there has been even less implemented legislation for minority groups.8 To improve CRC- related outcomes among minority populations, different screening approaches need to be put in place to overcome the systemic obstacles minorities face. Policy Idea To address the disparities in CRC treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention√ïs Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) should implement a policy to enhance CRC screenings by administering self-service kiosks that distribute at-home stool-based Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) kits to residents in the recommended age range of 45 to 75.9 These kiosks should be placed in high-traffic, non-clinical settings to optimize accessibility for minority populations. The FIT kits should be culturally tailored towards those minority groups, containing instructions and educational materials to address language barriers, discomfort, and any negative perceptions towards screenings. Along with these materials, a return envelope should be provided to mail the FIT kit to its respective testing site with a follow- up process for individuals that test positive to receive a colonoscopy. In accordance with these kiosks, community outreach groups will be constructed to advise how to improve distribution and other aspects of the screening process. Policy Analysis A policy implementing self- service kiosks that distribute FIT kits would require commitments from the CRCCP, community outreach groups, and participants. Placing automated kiosks in high- traffic areas would be practical and can be modeled on the administration of prior self-service COVID-19 and Influenza testing kiosks.10,11 This innovative approach to CRC screening increases convenience for residents and does not require access to health insurance or a primary care provider. Automated kiosks can be applied to various public health initiatives, such as screenings for HIV, to provide more equitable access to minority populations.12 At-home stool-based tests serve as viable substitutes to conventional screening methods in both their efficacy and distribution. The FIT kit is a unique method of screening
