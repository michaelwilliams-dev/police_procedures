powers. This is particularly important where powers of entry are used for enforcement purposes. Generally, a record should include:  the statutory provision under which the power was exercised;  the approval process that allowed for the exercise of the power of entry, and whether it was exercised with or without a warrant;  the address of the premises entered;  whether the occupier granted consent and what attempts were made to obtain consent;  the date, time and duration that powers were exercised;  the names of those involved in exercising powers and names of any other persons present (if known), unless operational imperatives are sensitive and require that the names of those involved are withheld or not disclosed;  any grounds for the refusal of any requests made by an occupier;  a list of any items seized, and if not covered by a warrant, the grounds for their seizure;  whether reasonable force was used; and if so, why;  details of any damage caused and the reason / circumstances; and  details, where known, of premises crossed to gain access to other premises. 20.2 When powers are exercised under warrant, following its use, the record should show as a minimum:  the name of Justice of the Peace or judge / judicial authority issuing the warrant;  the date and time the warrant was executed, and if present name of occupier or person in charge of the premises;  names of authorised persons executing warrant and anyone accompanying them;  whether a copy of the warrant (together with Notice of Powers and Rights) was handed to the occupier, or, left on the premises and where;   whether any articles specified in the warrant were found, and their location,  whether any other articles were seized;  advice provided to the occupier about consequences of any obstruction; and  information about any obstructive conduct by an occupier. 20.3 A briefer record may be appropriate in certain situations such as routine inspections or visits or where the occupier consents to the visit and no issues of concern arise. Such records should nevertheless make clear the statutory power being exercised and details of the purposes and outcomes of the inspection or visit. 20.4 In the case of routine checks on vehicles at ports, where a check or search is brief, the person concerned consents to the search and no issues of concern arise, it may not be necessary to maintain a record of the search. Operational discretion should be exercised, bearing in mind the possibility that a challenge to the legal justification for, or conduct of, the search may be raised at a later date. 21 Register of exercise of powers 21.1 Ideally, a register should be maintained containing the record of exercise of powers of entry or associated powers under paragraph 20 of this Code. 22 Conflict of interests 22.1 An authorised person should notify his / her manager immediately if any situation arises which might reasonably
