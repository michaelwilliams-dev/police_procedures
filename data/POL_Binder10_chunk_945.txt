It is explicit within the medical declaration form that failure to disclose fully will be regarded as a failure of the test.

Testing of individuals for potential substance misuse may be carried out in the following circumstances: - > Testing with cause (i.e. where there is a reasonable suspicion of substance misuse, see section on testing with cause for further guidance). > Pre-employment screening and testing in the probationary period (see below paragraph for guidance) > Random screening of officers identified by the Chief Officer as being in a vulnerable or safety critical post. > As part of a random routine testing regime.
