Table 6 show the number of panels required for each protection level for certification testing in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6 and7. For ballistic testing to HO3, HO4 and SG1 protection levels, plates may be assessed as standalone products or in conjunction with previously certified HO1 or HO2 panels which have been assessed and certified accordingly. Refer to Section 10 for PQT. Table 5: Quantities of armour required for ballistic test certification F = front panel; B = back panel; dark grey boxes ร no panels required. 12 All formed armour submitted for testing shall be sized in accordance with specifications in Section 0. 13 All plates submitted for testing shall be sized in accordance with specifications in Section 4.3.1.3. * If intended for female end-users (standalone or in conjunction with certified soft armour), an additional two plates are required, sized to fit the female large torso mannequin. ** A single small and large extended coverage panel is required per ammunition type at each protection level.

Pre-testing assessments 5.1. General information On submission of samples for testing, test facilities shall be supplied with a redacted technical file from the manufacturer containing the details specified in Section 3.6.3. This technical file shall be used in assessments to enable comparisons with the supplied armour. 5.2. Summary of assessments 5.2.1. Inspection Initially, on receipt of armour from the manufacturer, a visual inspection shall be performed to assess general quality of construction. Defects such as damage, blisters, cracks, tears, fraying and stitching separation shall be recorded. 5.2.2. Areal density Prior to testing, all submitted protective panels shall be weighed outside of their carriers on a calibrated set of scales, accurate to 0.1 g. The size of each panel, excluding armour covers, shall then be checked against dimensioned drawings provided by the manufacturer. This shall include, as a minimum, the overall width (largest separation in horizontal axis), overall height (largest separation in vertical axis), height and width of tapered regions, as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: Dimensional measurements on submitted armour On these drawings the manufacturer shall provide confirmation of the surface area of each panel construction submitted. The mass of the protective panels and associated areas shall then be used with the stated area to calculate areal density. Should there be a deviation between the drawings provided by the manufacturer and the dimensions measured of greater than 5% in any single measurement, the area of the panel shall be calculated manually by tracing around the perimeter of the armour using PolyartTM paper (140 g.m-2, 0.175 mm thickness).14 This paper shall then be weighed and used to calculate areal density using Equation (3). ?????????? ??????????????
