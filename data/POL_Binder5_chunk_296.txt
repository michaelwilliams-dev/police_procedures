or resin anchors. Each sheet should be butt jointed; or ii) to steel angle frame of not less than 50mm by 50mm by 3mm with cross rails at not more than 1.2 metre centres to form an internal lining cage. 45. Roof/ceiling: the roof or ceiling of an armoury should be constructed by any of the following methods: a) solid reinforced concrete of 150mm minimum thickness, tied into the walls. Where this forms the roof of a building, the concrete may be sloped to assist in draining of water. In this case, the thickness at the roof edge shall not be less than 120mm; b) vaulted brickwork or masonry, providing a ceiling of solid materials of not less than 300mm thickness; c) in the case of an existing roof/ceiling: i) upgrading by reinforced concrete to give a resistance comparable with a) above; ii) fitting of a substantial internal wire reinforcement of not less than 4.5mm thickness and of 50mm by 20mm maximum mesh size, secured to the floor joists using washers or proprietary steel clips held by screws of not less than 10 gauge giving a penetration into timber of at least 60mm at not more than 300mm centres; iii) the reinforcing should be laid so that the mesh, when reaching the edges of the ceiling/roof is either:  folded down and secured to the walls with masonry or other heavy duty fixings; or  welded onto steel angle which is secured to the wall with masonry or other heavy duty fixings 46. Floor: the floor of an armoury should be constructed either by: a) solid reinforced concrete of 150mm minimum thickness, tied to the walls. Where this forms part of the floor for any other part of the premises, this required thickness need only extend so far as is necessary to ensure the integrity of the bond between walls and the floor of the armoury; or b) vaulted brickwork or masonry, providing a floor of solid materials of not less than 300mm thickness; or c) in the case of an existing concrete, brickwork or masonry floor, by the provision of suitable upgrading to ensure that the provisions in the forgoing paragraphs are met; or d) in the case of an existing suspended timber floor: i) fitting of a sheet steel flooring, not less than 3mm in thickness, secured to the joists of the floor by screws of not less than 10 gauge giving a penetration into timber of at least 60mm at not more than 300mm centres; or i) ii) fitting of a substantial internal wire reinforcement of not less than 2.3mm thickness, and of 50mm by 20mm maximum mesh size. The panels to be overlaid by timber flooring of not less than 18mm thick secured to the floor joists by screws of not less than 10 gauge giving a penetration into the joist timber of at least 60mm at not more than 300mm centres. The finished floor being a sandwich of floorboard, mesh, overlaid floorboard laid so that
