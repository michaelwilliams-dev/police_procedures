The mean permissible BFS measurements have been specified in Table 8. For all protection levels a single shot limit (SSL) has been defined, which gives a maximum BFS limit for a single ballistic shot of a given test round in each protection level for a test series. 19 7.62 x 39 mm surrogate round details provided in Appendix D. 20 Any armour submitted for testing to the HO4 protection level shall also meet the requirements of the HO3 protection level. If standalone plates (without soft armour) are submitted for assessment, consideration should be given to satisfy the ballistic certification requirements of the HO2 protection level using the rifle shot templates and methods outlined in Section 6.7. The protection levels listed in Table 8 are defined as minimum protection levels. If, based on the threat and risk assessment, there is a requirement to incorporate additional ammunition this may be done either in addition to any protection level or, for specialist uses, on its own as a ÔspecialÕ protection level. Consideration should be given to the requirement to assess any protection level against UK law enforcement ammunition. Due to potential variation in law enforcement ammunition this has not been included in the protection levels. This should be incorporated, as an enhancement, into the relevant protection level for specialist users. Examples of ÔspecialÕ test rounds that may be used include, but are not limited to, the rounds specified in Table 9.
