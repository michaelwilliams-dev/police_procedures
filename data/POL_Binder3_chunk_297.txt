Family First: A Call for Mandatory Paid Family Leave By Emily Snider, ems459@cornell.edu The United States should enact a federal, mandatory paid family leave policy to strengthen its economy, improve public health, and promote equity. Background The United States remains the only high-income country without a national paid parental leave policy, despite strong evidence linking paid leave to improved health outcomes for parents and children.1 The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is the only federal leave policy, offering up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave yearly for eligible employees.2 This leave can cover childbirth, adoption, care for immediate family members with serious health conditions, and personal medical leave for a serious health condition.2 The FMLAÕs eligibility criteria include that employees must have at least 12 months of tenure, have worked at least 1,250 hours over the past year, and be employed by companies with 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius.2 Beyond this federal policy, some states have implemented unique paid family leave policies. Thirteen states and Washington, D.C. have enacted mandatory paid family leave, and nine states have voluntary policies using private health insurance.3 In most states with mandatory leave laws, the policies are funded through social insurance payroll taxes levied
