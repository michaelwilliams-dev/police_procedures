Incorporating Culturally Responsive Teaching into School to Increase Academic Success By Sejal Sekhar, scs326@cornell.edu Over 25 states have introduced anti-DEI bills targeting higher education, which have put students of color at a disadvantage socially and academically. To counter these laws, culturally responsive teaching needs to be implemented. Background In recent years, party lines have reshaped Americaâs education system. With anti-Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) bills introduced in over twenty-five states, education differs heavily from state to state.1 Of the 86 proposed bills, 14 have received final legislative approval and become law, which aims to restrict mandatory DEI training, DEI offices and staff, diversity statements, and identity-based preferences for hiring and admissions.2 The start of 2023 marks the push by Republican politicians to limit and ban DEI initiatives, and with the Supreme Courtâs decision to ban affirmative action, the agenda was furthered.3 Polling found approximately 77% of Republicans believe discrimination against white and black people is equally problematic, which underscores why some lawmakers are pushing for DEI restriction.4 One of the main groups affected by DEI policies, bans, and restrictions is college students. When asked what they would do if their college abolished DEI initiatives, 55% of polled college students reported they would consider transferring schools.5 In addition, 59% of students stated that they would reconsider enrolling in their respective universities if they lacked DEI initiatives.6 While many lawmakers believe establishing anti- DEI bills is better for the country, most college students clearly disagree. Beyond college students, around 61% of the American public support DEI programs.7 One of the main harms caused by banning or limiting DEI in schools is the threat to cultural competence and the undermining of the student community, which is why colleges need to continue supporting their students by developing alternative solutions to ensure equal representation. Policy Idea Colleges should implement culturally responsive teaching as an effective way
