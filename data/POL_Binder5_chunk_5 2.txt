This measure closes a legislative gap in respect of two key terrorism offences and offer further opportunities for our law enforcement partners to take action against those involved in terrorist preparation. 8. The changes are in keeping with the spirit of the existing legislation, given that the UK already takes extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of a number of other terrorism offences5. Home Office March 2015 3 The measure will allow for an individual to be prosecuted for the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism in addition to a Convention offence, where the activity falling within section 6, takes place abroad. 4 See section 19 of the Terrorism Act 2006. 5 See section 17 of the Terrorism Act 2006. 3 Serious Crime Act 2015 Fact sheet: Approval of draft decisions under Article 352 of the TFEU Section 8 of the European Union Act 2011 1. Section 82 provides, for the purposes of section 8 of the European Union Act 2011, for the approval of two draft decisions of the Council of the European Union to be made under Article 352 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU"). Article 352 of the TFEU is a legal base for measures that are in line with the objectives set out in the Treaties, but for which the Treaties have not explicitly provided the necessary powers. Under section 8 of the European Union Act 2011, a Minister of the Crown may not support an Article 352 decision unless the draft decision has been first approved by an Act of Parliament (there are limited exceptions to this requirement, but none apply in this instance). Draft Decision to repeal Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom 2. The first draft decision is in respect of the repeal of Council Decision 2007/124/EC, Euratom1 (Òthe 2007 DecisionÓ). The 2007 Decision established, for the period 2007 to 2013, an EU funding programme to protect people and critical infrastructure against terrorist attacks and other security-related incidents. As the period covered by this programme had expired, the 2007 Decision was due to be repealed; it is the draft Council decision2 affecting that repeal which is the subject of this provision. The funding programme provided for by the 2007 Decision has been replaced by the Internal Security Fund (Police) which will shortly be adopted by the Council. The Internal Security Fund will continue to fund many of the activities foreseen by the 2007 Decision including the protection of people and critical infrastructure and the management of security-related risks and crises. The UK has not opted in to the Internal Security Fund measure pre-adoption; no decision has been taken by the Government on whether to do so post-adoption. The "Pericles" programme 3. The second of the draft decisions to which section 82 applies relates to the ÒPericles" programme. The Pericles programme was established in 2001
