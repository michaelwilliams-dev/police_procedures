which 33,793 are incarcerated in New York State (NYS).1 In the US, two- thirds of these incarcerated individuals also work, performing jobs similar to those of unincarcerated individuals.2 However, the legal protections afforded to these workers differ significantly based on their incarcerated status. The Thirteenth Amendment of the US Constitution protects unincarcerated individuals from unethical labor practices yet explicitly omits those Òheld in confinement due to criminal conviction.Ó2 The Fair Labor Standards Act further permits unethical practices via their definitions of employees and employers.3 Consequently, incarcerated workers face harsh working conditions, with more than 76 percent of inmates reporting they are forced to either work or face solitary confinement.2 In US prisons, inmates are assigned either industry or non- industry work. The former refers to jobs that involve manufacturing signs or furniture, while the latter refers to prison support jobs in the maintenance sector.4 In NYS, non- industry jobs, which pay less than industry jobs at an hourly wage between $0.10 to $0.33, are the most common.3 These wages come from less than one percent of the stateÕs correctional budget.2 Additionally, non-industry wages in NYS are significantly lower than the nationwide incarcerated average of $0.86 per hour.5 Such non-industry wages lead to financial instability that drastically affects incarcerated individuals during incarceration and reintegration. With their current meager wages, the 95 percent of incarcerated individuals returning to their communities lack financial safety, increasing their risk of recidivism, as full-time incarcerated workers earn approximately $2000 annually Ñ far below the $35,000 needed to cover a modest cost of living in NYS.6,7 Therefore, the NYS non-industry wages are insufficient for most prisoners supporting their families. Policy Idea NYS should implement a pre-release earnings program that provides individuals incarcerated for non-violent crimes with living wages in the form of state minimum wage. This program would be implemented after an individual is granted parole, limiting the programÕs scope while increasing its financial feasibility. Focusing on non-violent offenders prioritizes lower-risk individuals, making the initiative affordable and appealing to the public. The American Correctional Association and the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) must ensure fair wages by aligning prison labor pay with living costs. Additionally, non-violent inmates granted parole would be required to establish mandatory savings accounts Ñ with a minimum of 80 percent of inmatesÕ total wages, considering their minimal financial responsibilities Ñ which they can access upon release. While some may argue that incarcerated individuals do not deserve higher wages due to their criminal record, fair pay reduces reoffending rates and supports successful reintegration, ultimately enhancing public safety. Policy Analysis Empirical evidence supports financial stabilityÕs role in reducing recidivism rates.9 Research at the University of Southern California (USC) reveals that economic stability is directly correlated to reduced recidivism as criminal behavior is closely linked to income levels.9 Beyond USC, College Bound Dorchester, a Boston-based non-profit, has given those with a criminal record in Richmond, California, a $400 weekly stipend.10 Over the next seven years, the city saw a decrease of over 50 percent
