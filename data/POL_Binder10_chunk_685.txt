Your line manager will arrange a meeting with you to discuss these issues before your return to work if you would find that useful. Your line manager will also have regular meetings with you after your return to work so that we can continue to provide adequate support. 4.9 Rights of partners and fathers/parents We recognise that the loss of a baby is a distressing experience for both parents. Therefore, the individual whose partner has a miscarriage or stillbirth, or the father or parent of the baby who has passed away, may also need support or be eligible for time off. The sources of practical and emotional support listed above are also open to fathers and partners and we encourage employees to access these. The Miscarriage Association has published guidance Partners Too, which they may find helpful. They should discuss any additional support that they need with their line manager. The right to time off for partners and fathers/parents depends on how long the pregnancy lasted. 4.9.1 Miscarriage Individuals can take a reasonable amount of unpaid time off, also known as time off for dependants, to provide assistance if their spouse or civil partner falls ill.
