of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 20031 and extends to England and Wales only. Section 5C(1) states: Ò(1) The Secretary of State may issue guidance to whatever persons in England and Wales the Secretary of State considers appropriate aboutÑ (a) the effect of any provision of this Act, or (b) other matters relating to female genital mutilation. (2) A person exercising public functions to whom guidance is given under this section must have regard to it in the exercise of those functions. (3) Nothing in this section permits the Secretary of State to give guidance to any court or tribunal.Ó As statutory guidance issued under section 5C of the 2003 Act, a person exercising public functions to whom this guidance is given must have regard to it in the exercise of those functions. This means that a person to whom the guidance is given must take the guidance into account and, if they decide to depart from it, have clear reasons for doing so. It contains guidance which should be followed by all; these sections are generally identified by the use of the word ÔshouldÕ and are contained within the main body of the guidance. It also contains guidance that may be appropriate for some individuals, but may not be required by others. This latter guidance is identified by terminology such as Ôyou may find it useful toÕ and is set out within the Annexes. 1 As amended by the Serious Crime Act 2015. 1.2. Audience This multi-agency statutory guidance should be read and followed by all persons and bodies in England and Wales who are under statutory duties to make arrangements to discharge their functions having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children2 and vulnerable adults.
