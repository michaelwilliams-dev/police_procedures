VICTIMS COLLECTING THEIR OWN EVIDENCE In all appropriate cases victims should be encouraged to keep a diary/log of all the incidents (Form 271: Stalking and Harassment Diary). All information should be recorded in one diary where possible and victims should write incidents in them as soon as possible after the event to ensure they record it accurately. Good practise for recording in a diary includes:  Time and date every entry.  Keep a detailed record of the circumstances; where were they, who was there, what happened, anything significant such as it being dark etc.  Do not delete anything. Keep all messages, phone calls, emails etc. stored on the electronic device.  Record what the suspect was wearing, where they were, what they sounded like (angry, excited etc.) and any vehicle they were in.  Ask neighbours where appropriate to also keep a log if they see suspect loitering outside address etc.  Keep letters and parcels believed to be from the suspect.  Use 1471 and record all phone numbers that the suspect may be using.  Where possible record telephone conversations and save these.  Ask colleagues, employers, building security (where appropriate) and family & friends to keep a log of any incidents they have witnessed/heard. 9.
