departure, including Òstressful working conditionsÓ with insufficient time allocated to training and a shortage of both Òsuitable consultant postsÓ and Òcareer progression opportunities.Ó3 In particular, there are insufficient Òpost-CSCST fellowships available in IrelandÓ: in 2022, there were only 68 such fellowships but 452 CSCST graduates.4 In 2015, researchers found that doctors working abroad were interested in returning if Òworking conditions in IrelandÓ improved substantially.3 Policy Idea In their Annual Medical Retention Report 2023, the National Doctors Training and Planning unit (NDTP) of the Health Service Executive emphasized that there are Òno formal structures to maintain contact with CSCSTs who leave IrelandÓ and suggested Òtargeted recruitment strategiesÓ could encourage their return.4 The NDTP should create an international recruitment program for doctors who received CSCSTs in Ireland. The NDTP helps run the Doctors Integrated Management E-System (DIME) database, which records information about NCHDs working in the Irish public healthcare system and can be used to document when doctors Òleave and return.Ó4 The NDTP should use the NCHD contact information stored in DIME to contact those who receive their CSCSTs in Ireland but are not actively registered with the Irish Medical Council (IMC) when (1) there are recruitment opportunities for consultants and (2) improvements are made in the Irish healthcare system to encourage their return and retention. Policy Analysis No similar policies are known to exist in other countries. Ireland has a unique culture of migration among those in their 20s, including doctors.1,4 Most specialties even Òencourage trainees to migrate to achieve career progression.Ó4 Ireland requires culturally conscious policies, such as this recruitment program built around the migrational culture of CSCSTs. While the Irish government did not substantially implement previous policy reports proposing solutions to IrelandÕs healthcare workforce issues, it is implementing the 2017 National Strategic Framework for Health and Social Care Workforce Planning (NSF).1 As the recruitment policy would fall under the Òrevising recruitment strategiesÓ objective of Òpolicies to address inflows and outflowsÓ outlined in the NSFÕs Health Labour Market Framework, it would align with current workforce planning goals.2 For the 2016-2019 CSCST recipients, retention rates (measured by the number of recipients working as consultants in Ireland in 2023) were lower in ÒRadiology, Medicine and Anaesthesiology,Ó so the recruitment program should prioritize connecting with CSCSTs in these disciplines.4 Additionally, Òretention rates of Irish cohorts are on average 12-13% higher than the EU/UK and non-EU cohorts,Ó so the program should prioritize communication with Irish CSCSTs whose increased retention may result in increased receptivity to outreach.4 Lastly, a 2016 research study found that Òthe longer a health professional remained abroad, the less likely they were to return to make their careers in Ireland.Ó3 The recruitment program should increase outreach Òduring the Ôcritical periodÕ in the early yearsÓ following emigration.3 While factors such as career prospects lead Irish-trained physicians abroad, throughout post- graduate training, Òthe lack of substantive improvements in conditions back in Ireland ...keeps them abroad.Ó3 The Irish healthcare system could better increase CSCST return by also using the recruitment program to update CSCSTs
