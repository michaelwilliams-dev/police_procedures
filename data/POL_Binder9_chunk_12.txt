Section 352(5).  a statement that the warning given does not constitute a criminal caution, nor has the consequences of one;  a general description of the investigation in connection with which the requirement is made (it is not necessary to specify the name of the person or property subject to the investigation on the order, although this information should be given to the judge as part of the application process);  that the subject of the order, warrant or notice should seek legal advice or ask the appropriate officer about any doubts or concerns they may have, or for guidance on complying with the order, warrant or notice;  a statement to the effect that disclosure of information about the investigation or falsifying, concealing, destroying or otherwise disposing of, or causing or permitting the falsification, concealment, destruction or disposal of documents which are relevant to the investigation may be an offence under section 342 (offences of prejudicing investigation) punishable by up to five years imprisonment;  the right to apply for a variation or discharge of the order or notice (not applicable in search and seizure warrants).
