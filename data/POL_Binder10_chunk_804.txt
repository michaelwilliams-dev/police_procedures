This procedure is to be used in matters which relate to an employeeÕs conduct and applies to formal disciplinary action. If the matter in question relates to an individualÕs capability and/or performance, then this procedure should not be used. You should refer to the separate ÔManaging Performance and Capability ProcedureÕ. In some cases, managers will consider counselling and/or training and development measures which may be more appropriate as a means of addressing performance which is below standard or for minor matters of unsatisfactory conduct. In this respect, the Performance Development Review (PDR) should be utilised should these informal measures not resolve the problem it may be necessary for more formal action to be invoked. Managers should ensure that expected standards of work and behaviour are clearly communicated to staff. Records will be kept detailing the nature of any breach of disciplinary rules, the employeeÕs mitigation, the action taken and the reasons for it, whether an appeal was lodged, its outcome and any subsequent developments. These records will be retained on the employeeÕs personal file in accordance with The Procedure and subject to any statutory requirements as detailed within the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Data Protection Act 2018 and/or the Police Reform Act 2002.
