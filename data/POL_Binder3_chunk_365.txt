The practice of personalized pricing is not novel; product costs have historically been variable, with factors including overhead, customer desire, and competitor prices all contributing to historical examples of individualized pricing.2 Studies additionally highlight potential consumer benefits, as personalized pricing profiles enable corporations to charge customers closer to their perceived willingness to pay, maximizing profit and market share.3 Personalized pricing schemes pose more harm than benefit, with these schemes often stifling market innovation, eviscerating consumer rights and privacy, and setting a dangerous precedent for how much control the public is willing to give algorithms over our daily lives. Potential risks include the exploitation of less knowledgeable consumers, the targeting of behavioral biases, violations of national discrimination law, and shifting market share towards corporations with the resources to engage in large-scale data collection and analysis.4 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently issued an investigative probe requesting information regarding the use of surveillance pricing methods across four key areas: types of products and services offered, data collection and inputs, customer and sales information, and impact on consumers and prices.1 This investigative probe is not intended to result in policy action, instead focusing on further establishing the current landscape of surveillance pricing. Policy Idea The FTC should implement the following initiatives: establish a dedicated algorithmic marketing investigative division within the Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) focused primarily on enforcement and consumer reporting, establish data disclosure requirements for corporations including specific details data collection practices and usage in pricing schemes, and create a third-party auditing and certification system for companies that adhere to consumer data privacy standards. By implementing this three- pronged policy approach, the FTC can effectively provide a sense of regulatory stability to the sphere of algorithmic consumer protection, set up a foundation for future data privacy standards, and place power back in the hands of individual consumers. Policy Analysis Establishing a dedicated algorithmic marketing investigative division within the BCP would allow the FTC to effectively leverage pre-existing administrative structures to enforce the second prong of this policy proposal, specifically data disclosure. The current focuses of the BCP include their work within the Division of Privacy & Identity Protection, which operates online assistance and a call center for victims of identity theft.5 Implementing a similar structure for algorithmic pricing schemes would increase the efficacy of the other two prongs of this proposal, as well as offer consumers an avenue for individual recourse and advisement. Additionally, the division√ïs placement within the BCP would leverage already existing organizational structures, with divisions such as the Division of Financial Practices currently focusing on emerging technology broadly.6 Establishing data disclosure requirements would similarly pressure corporations to adhere to equitable pricing schemes. Structuring a data disclosure requirement similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would require companies to disclose what data is being collected and for what purpose.7 The efficacy of this policy is demonstrated by the effects of GDPR, with a survey of EU citizens finding that 60% of
