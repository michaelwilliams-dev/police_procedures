test or proof (section 8(2)(b) of the 1968 Act). It would be good practice for the dealer and persons to whom carriers or warehousemen or their servants are delivering a firearm or ammunition in the ordinary course of business to ask to see a certificate (section 9(4) of the 1968 Act) or proof that the person collecting the shot gun is entitled to possess it without a certificate. 37 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law Pawnbrokers 5.26 Whilst section 3(6) of the 1968 Act prohibits pawnbrokers from taking in pawn any firearm or ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, or any shot gun, a pawnbroker is not debarred from registration as a firearms dealer. In these circumstances, the police will wish to consider an application under the same terms as any other dealer. Sales of firearms unproven or out of proof 5.27 The provisions of the Gun Barrel Proof Acts are explained in Chapter 23. Records of transactions 5.28 Persons who by way of trade or business manufacture, sell or transfer firearms or ammunition to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, shot guns, or air weapons, are required by section 40 of the 1968 Act to keep a register of transactions and to enter in it the particulars specified in Schedule 4 to the Act and Part 4 of Schedule 5 to the Firearms Rules 1998 (firearms dealerÕs register of transactions) (as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) (No.2) Rules 2019). The Act does not specifically require a registered dealer to be satisfied before purchasing a firearm to which section 1 applies, or a shot gun, that the vendor is in possession of a certificate for that firearm, but the dealer is required to record the transaction in the register. 5.29 It is good practice for firearms dealers to notify their local police where they take in firearms, including shot guns, which are not held lawfully on a firearm or shot gun certificate. This will enable the police to make checks to ensure they are not recorded as lost or stolen. 5.30 Section 18(1) of the 1988 Act allows a visitor who has not been in Great Britain for more than thirty days in the preceding twelve months to purchase a firearm from a firearms dealer for the purpose only of it being exported without first coming into their possession without the need for a certificate. A firearms dealer is required to record the transaction in their register together with the number and place of issue of any passport in the purchaserÕs possession. A passport will normally provide evidence for a firearms dealer that a visitor satisfies the thirty day criterion. Section 40(7) of the 1968 Act empowers the Secretary of State to make rules varying or adding to Schedule 4 of the 1968 Act. Such changes were made by Rule 10(5) of the Firearms Rules 1998 and by the Firearms (Amendment) Rules 2007. 5.31 Section 38(8) of the 1968 Act provides for the surrender of
