This may include setting clear expectations on responding adequately and effectively to victims of crimes including victims of domestic abuse related crimes incidents. PCCs should consider how they work with other partners to provide an efficient and effective criminal justice system for their local areas including in relation to domestic abuse related crime and incidents to support prevention, early intervention and the provision of services. This may involve bringing partners together through convening and leading forums such as Local Criminal Justice Boards (LCJBs) and some areas will have other partnership boards working alongside or reporting into the LCJBs. For example, there are often boards, and other structures, with a particular focus on domestic abuse and sexual violence.

Every charging decision is based on the same two-stage test outlined in the Code for Crown Prosecutors: Does the evidence provide a realistic prospect of conviction? That means, having heard the evidence, is a court more likely than not to find the defendant guilty? Is it in the public interest to prosecute?
