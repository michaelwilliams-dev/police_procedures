Once captured, they must be systematically managed as business records according to the policy and standard working principles highlighted within this document. The integrity of police information relies on the information being trusted, acceptable, useable and available. It should be in a format that is accessible and easy to use, whether it is an electronic, photographic or paper format. The purpose of records management from policing and business perspectives is to ensure that information is documented and maintained in such a way that its evidential weight and integrity is not compromised over time. To achieve this, records must be managed throughout their lifecycle, from creation through to disposal. Applicability A record is defined as Òinformation created, received, and maintained as evidence and information by an organisation or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.Ó (BS ISO
