over 262 workdays per year, this results in 2.41 billion rides annually.11 At the current fare of $2.90 per ride, this amounts to nearly $3.495 billion in lost revenue each year.12 Fares currently account for 23% of the MTAâs $19.38 billion budget, making this a substantial financial loss.13 To compensate for these lost fares, the MTA could tap into funds from the recently raised NYC congestion tax, which is projected to provide $15 billion over 4 years to fund MTA expansion.14 This would eliminate the need for fare hikes, as using congestion tax funds would allow the $3.495 billion in lost fare revenue to be covered, given that the tax provides $3.75 billion in increased revenue per year to the MTA.14 This increased access to public transit for low-income individuals from Fair Fares would support upward economic mobility for low-income individuals. Limited public transit expansion has been correlated with higher rates of unemployment, meaning that increasing public transit access would decrease unemployment rates for low-income individuals.15 This decrease in unemployment rates would bring lower-income individuals closer to higher-income NYC residents, thereby increasing chances for upward economic mobility.15 There is also a positive relationship between transit access and the wealth of a neighborhood due to job access.15 Fare reduction programs for low-income residents have proven to be successful in other cities. The Boston city government implemented a 50% fare reduction program for low-income residents, projected to increase low-income ridership by 30%.16 Highlights As of 2024, income inequality in the US is growing, with the top 10% of households holding 67% of the nationâs wealth, while the bottom 50% holds only 2.5%.1 Access to public transportation has proven to be a powerful tool for reducing poverty, enabling individuals to reach job opportunities quickly and efficiently.5 Affordability remains a significant barrier, as approximately 30% of impoverished people struggle to afford public transportation.8 The city government of Boston implemented a 50% fare reduction program for low-income residents in the summer of 2024, which is expected to increase low- income ridership by 30%.16 In order to address this problem, the New York City Government should expand their current Fair Fares program to those living at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, giving them half-price fares on all MTA subways and non-express buses. Implementation The Office of NYC Councilwoman Selvena Brooks- Powers should sponsor the bill for this policy in the NYC Council, which would most likely pass due to the tendency of NYC residents and the City Council to support socially liberal policies such as this one. Councilwoman Brooks-Powers brings valuable experience in directing infrastructure funding and currently serves as the Chair of the Committee of Transportation and Infrastructure.17 Given their history of endorsing public transit improvements, advocacy organizations, including Transportation for America and the American Public Transportation Association, would also support the proposal by lobbying other NYC councilmembers.18, 19 The NYC Council would work closely with the MTA to administer and oversee the expanded program. The main challenge to implementing this expansion
