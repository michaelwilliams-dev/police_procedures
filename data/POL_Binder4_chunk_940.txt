is helpful to highlight the experiences of deaf victims who as a community are a linguistic minority based on their language and many deaf people experience personal and structural barriers in accessing help and reporting abuse. Deaf people may encounter specific barriers to accessing support when experiencing controlling or coercive behaviour as they might not be aware of the available support and/or professionals may not know to use appropriate communication methods. There is likely to be underreporting of abuse by deaf victims due to communication and information barriers. Professionals and service providers should be aware that deaf victims need specialist support services who can understand their cultural and linguistic needs. Where possible, professionals working with deaf victims should be expected to have some personal experience of deafness, as having to relive their trauma time and again with new people (e.g. sign language interpreters) can be disruptive to their healing and may result in them disengaging from much needed support.

Many speech and language difficulties are unidentified and undiagnosed. Services should seek to understand the needs of people with these difficulties, including the risk that they may not be, or have been, taken seriously in their reports because of the way that they communicated them. Speech, language, and communication needs can be a risk factor and are often hidden. They can result from lifelong or acquired conditions and for children and young people they may be part of a
