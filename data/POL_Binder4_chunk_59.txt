in New York City, where the wealthiest 20% of Manhattan residents earn, on average, 53 times more than the bottom 20%.2 Statewide, the top 1% earn over 44 times more than the bottom 99%.3 States with higher income inequality have lower life expectancies and higher mortality and obesity rates.4 Public transit provides low- income individuals, who often cannot afford cars, access to jobs to bring themselves out of poverty.5 Residents of the 10 lowest-income city council districts in New York are 45% more likely to commute via bus than the average New Yorker.6 However, the affordability of public transit remains a significant barrier for many low- income households.7 In New York City, as of 2024, 20% of residents reported difficulty affording public transit, rising to 30% among those living in poverty.8 In response to these challenges, the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) introduced the Fair Fares program, which offers half-priced transit for NYC residents living at or below 120% of the federal poverty level. However, only 56% of eligible New Yorkers have enrolled due to a lack of advertising, public awareness, and potentially fare evasion as well.8 Many eligible residents were unaware of the program or unsure how to apply.7 Furthermore, many low-income workers do not qualify for the program because of the enrollment threshold.8 It is clear that expanded public transit assistance for low-income individuals is needed to address the high cost of transit for low-income New Yorkers, which will serve as a critical step in reducing the cityâs high income inequality levels. Policy Idea To address New York Cityâs extreme levels of income inequality due to inequality in transportation access, the NYC government should expand the Fair Fares program to residents living at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, as the current 120% threshold still excludes some residents who cannot afford transit. This policy would make subways and non-express buses half-price for eligible residents, allowing them to access jobs to bring themselves out of poverty. Participants would apply for a special MetroCard, granting them half-price access to these services, and they would renew their eligibility annually to ensure they still meet the income requirements. The program would be funded using the NYC congestion tax on cars, set to provide $15 billion to the MTA from 2020-2024. Funding may also include federal government subsidies. The policy would be proposed through NYC Councilwoman Selvena Brooks- Powers, the Chair of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Policy Analysis The primary cost of expanding the Fair Fares program for low-income NYC residents would be the lost fare revenue from approximately 4.6 million NYC citizens who would no longer pay full fares.9,10 Assuming these individuals use the subway or bus twice daily over 262 workdays per year, this results in 2.41 billion rides annually.11 At the current fare of $2.90 per ride, this amounts to nearly $3.495 billion in lost revenue each year.12 Fares currently account for 23% of the MTAâs $19.38 billion budget, making this a substantial financial loss.13 To compensate
