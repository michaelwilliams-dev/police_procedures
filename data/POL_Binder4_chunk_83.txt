everyone feels valued, it is vital to create substitute programs amidst the recent legislation targeting DEI practices. Highlights The increasing attacks on efforts to ensure minorities have an equal playing field makes culturally responsive teaching essential for creating an immediate impact. Over 100 bills in 30 states are working to limit or ban DEI policies such as DEI training, DEI offices and staff, diversity statements, and identity-based preferences for hiring and admissions within higher education.2 To counter anti-DEI legislation, culturally responsive teaching can be implemented to ensure equity remains at the forefront of education. Culturally responsive teaching fosters a more inclusive classroom by creating a space where individuals can learn from each otherâs backgrounds, become more informed, and therefore increase collaboration and problem- solving skills.8 Implementation Implementing culturally responsive teaching is simple and has significant benefits. This teaching increases face-to-face communication, open dialogue, and integration of current world issues to better understand studentsâ backgrounds into the curriculum.9 Therefore, culturally responsive teaching can work to create the same environment DEI policies promote by making students conscious of biases while increasing studentsâ academic performance. Implementing culturally responsive teaching should begin at higher education levels, as anti-DEI laws primarily target these institutions. It would be beneficial for school boards to look at New York Cityâs framework that affirms racial, linguistic and cultural identities by preparing students for rigorous learning through making them aware of differing perspectives to adequately enact culturally responsive teaching.12 Aiding students as well as teachers is key to making sure the plan can be successful. To understand the benefits in the long term, student and teacher surveys should be sent out at the beginning and end of each academic year to evaluate the progression of culturally responsive teaching. Increasing teacher diversity through recruiting from Minority-Serving Institutions, such as HBCUs, not only helps students due to culturally responsive teaching but also counters backlash from states that are anti-DEI. This way, schools are still able to push for representation and bridging cultural divides amidst hostile states working to eliminate DEI. To determine if culturally responsive teaching is effective, school boards should analyze studentsâ academic performance prior to and post-implementation in addition to a survey to gauge qualitative and quantitative data about the program, therefore allowing for improvement. Additionally, the retention rates within classes and majors should be used to determine if culturally responsive teaching effectively encourages students through engagement and participation. By collecting data and highlighting success progress, the school board can allocate more money to increasing culturally responsive teaching. Given the banning or limiting of DEI policies in higher education, the money spent on DEI can be reallocated to culturally responsive teaching. Typically, the widely accepted authors who have studied in traditional academic curricula are white. While there is the acknowledgment that there is nothing wrong with traditional readings, there is a push to incorporate more worldly literature.14 Through teachers adding more multicultural works into the curriculum, students can make their own interpretations about todayâs society and become more informed citizens
