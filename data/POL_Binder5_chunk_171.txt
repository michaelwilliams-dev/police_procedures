This is to reduce stress on birds, especially wildfowl, such as ducks, geese, rails and waders that are trying to conserve energy when feeding is difficult in frozen conditions. For freezing periods of 14 consecutive days or more, you must check if there is a statutory suspension on killing or taking any bird listed in Schedule 2 Part 1 of the 1981 Act. Read more about the severe weather scheme and when voluntary or statutory suspension applies on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee website. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation will also advertise periods of suspension. During periods of statutory suspension, you can kill or take Canada geese if it is essential. You must try to avoid disturbing any other wildfowl. Dates when other birds may be taken or killed (all dates are inclusive) Coot, Moorhen, and Golden Plover may be taken or killed outside the close season from 1 September to 31 January in England, Wales and Scotland.
