Executive summary Introduction The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) commissioned IFF Research to conduct a survey of businesses in key sectors to understand how they use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how businesses implement cyber security practices and processes around the AI technology they deploy. The quantitative survey was developed in collaboration with DSIT. Fieldwork was conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and took place between 10th January and 13th February 2024. A total of 350 interviews were completed with businesses currently using or considering using AI in nine sectors (see page 6 for more details) so that the survey had a robust number of participants. The core objectives of the research were to understand: What types of technology are being used, and for what purpose; BusinessesÕ cyber security practices Ð in general terms, and specific to AI; BusinessesÕ future plans in relation to AI and cyber security; and How these activities and attitudes vary across businesses
