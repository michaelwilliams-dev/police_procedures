There are several instances when Wiltshire Police departments will need to remove personal data from documents (word, images, PDF, excel etc.) prior to release to members of the public, insurance companies, statutory partners, CPS, solicitors (not an exhaustive list). Note: The simplest case of data being disclosed in error occurs when the data in question is not immediately visible on the screen but is elsewhere within the file. This can be due to a range of design choices or the rendering of certain formatting styles. For example, when setting up a template a user might have chosen to ÔhideÕ certain data by setting the font colour to be the same as the background (e.g. white on white or black on black). Whilst hiding data in this manner prevents personal data being disclosed on a printed version of the file, it will remain within the source file. This personal data is at risk of unintended disclosure if the electronic version is distributed. Highlighting the text or changing the font colour will expose it.
