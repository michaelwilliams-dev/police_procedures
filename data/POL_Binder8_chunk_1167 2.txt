Publicising details of particular gang injunctions Publicising the details of a respondent could put them at risk of harm from rival gangs and may breach their human rights. Applicants should take into account any court orders relating to disclosure and are encouraged to be mindful of the risks associated with publicity, to consider the value and appropriateness of publicity on a case by case basis, and to obtain legal advice about these and other data protection concerns before publicising these details.
