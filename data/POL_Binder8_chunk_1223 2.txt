Safety Bill, which sets out an enhanced regulatory regime for all buildings, including a more stringent fire and structural safety regime for higher-risk buildings, with residents having a strong voice in the system.  Published a Fire Safety Consultation on Government proposals to implement the recommendations in the Grenfell Tower InquiryÕs Phase 1 report that require changes to the law.  Supported a Social Sector (Building Safety) Engagement Best Practice Group, bringing together social landlords and residents from across the country to test approaches to engagement on building safety.  Published a Fire Safety Bill which will clarify the scope of the Fire Safety Order in its application to the structure, external walls and flat entrance doors in multi-occupied residential buildings. We will:  Legislate to strengthen the Regulator of Social HousingÕs consumer regulation objectives to explicitly include safety.  Legislate to require social landlords to identify a nominated person responsible for complying with their health and safety requirements.  Expect the Regulator of Social Housing to prepare a Memorandum of Understanding with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure effective sharing of information with the Building Safety Regulator.  Launch a consultation on mandating smoke and carbon monoxide alarms in social housing.  Consult on measures to ensure that social housing residents are protected from harm caused by poor electrical safety.  Build on the work of the Social Sector (Building Safety) Engagement Best Practice Group, supporting the development of statutory and good practice guidance on engaging residents in all tenures on safety issues.  The Charter for Social Housing Residents Ð Social Housing White Paper 15 Ensuring buildings are safe 1. Building safety is a top priority for the Government. We have already made up to £400 million available to social sector landlords to fund the removal and replacement of unsafe cladding of aluminium composite materials (ACM) on residential social housing buildings over 18 metres. At Budget 2020 we went further, announcing an additional £1 billion to accelerate the remediation of unsafe non-ACM on residential buildings over 18 metres. At the end of October 2020, 151 (97%) of the 155 social sector buildings identified with ACM cladding systems unlikely to meet Building Regulations had either completed or started remediation, with 90 (58%) having now completed remediation and 74% in total having de-risked the building by removing the ACM cladding. Plans are in place to remediate the remaining four buildings.5 2.

The new regimes will deliver stronger enforcement and sanctions to ensure homes are safe. These will ensure the right people are held to account and will drive a culture change to put safety first. Local enforcement agencies and national regulators, including a new Building Safety Regulator, will work together
