and ÔRight to BuyÕ, and we have cut stamp-duty for the majority of first-time buyers, helping over 540,000 people.44 These schemes are working and in 2018/19 the number of first-time buyers reached a 12-year annual high, and increased by over 87% since 2010/1145. However, we need to do more to support people to realise their dreams of home ownership. A new shared ownership model 154. Shared Ownership has a vital role to play in offering a route into homeownership to those who would otherwise struggle to buy a home. We know that there is more we can do to make Shared Ownership work better for those who need it most. This is why in September 2020 we introduced a new Shared Ownership model that will be more consumer-friendly and more accessible. The new Shared Ownership model will reduce the minimum initial ownership stake from 25% to 10% and will enable purchasers to then buy further shares in smaller instalments of as little as 1%. 155. Shared owners, like other homeowners, are currently responsible for the full cost of any repairs from day one. This means that those starting off with a small stake can be left with large bills. This is why we have also introduced a 10-year Òrepair-freeÓ period during which the landlord will cover the costs of major repairs for new homes. For most people entering into Shared Ownership, the scheme serves as a first step on their journey as homeowners. The new repairs model will help make the transition from renting to homeownership almost frictionless. The changes will prevent new shared owners being hit with repairs and maintenance bills and better support them to put money aside towards buying more of their home. 156. Together these measures will ensure Shared Ownership supports those who need it most by making it easier for hard working people and families to access and progress to full ownership. We are committed to continued investment in the delivery of Shared Ownership homes and will fund the new model through the new Affordable Homes Programme. 1. 43 MHCLG Calculation of Help to Buy and Right to Buy (24 September 2020) The figure of 649,996 households comprises of 96,420 Right to Buy local authority sales, 29,826 Right to Buy PRP sales, 272,852 Help to Buy: Equity Loan sales, 104,763 Help to Buy: Mortgage Guarantee sales (the Help to Buy: Mortgage Guarantee scheme operates across the UK, whereas all others in this note only operate in England), 5,694 Help to Buy: New Buy sales and 140,411 Affordable home ownership sales 44 Quarterly Stamp Duty Land Tax Statistics https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/904092/ Quarterly_SDLT_2020Q2_Main.pdf 45 UK Finance (previously Council of Mortgage Lenders), First-time buyers: new mortgages and affordability (18 February 2020) 68 The Charter for Social Housing Residents Ð Social Housing White Paper ÒWe are committed to developing more beautiful homes and communities.
