turnover means that contact details will need constant updating; o the responsibilities of the Category 1 responder - where a Category 1 responder takes on new functions or delivers new services, this should be reflected; o organisational structures - where responders have experienced restructuring this may need to be reflected in plans; o suppliers or contractors - ensuring that the details of suppliers and contractors are kept up to date; o risk assessments - the Act requires Category 1 responders to review plans in the light of changes to risk assessments; 13 and o business objectives/processes. 12 s.2(1)(c) 13 s.2(1)(e) 6.28.

Plan maintenance should take place on an ongoing basis, but all business continuity plans should be comprehensively reviewed at appropriate intervals. Publication of BCPs 6.29. Communication with customers or service users - who may need information about service continuity in the event of an emergency - is important to community resilience. Emergencies cause serious disruption to people√ïs lives and increase reliance on public sector bodies - provision of information about what they can and cannot expect from Category 1 responders in the event of an emergency, may help to minimise this disruption. 6.30.

Furthermore, the Regulations prohibit the publication of sensitive information (e.g. commercially confidential information, personal data) where consent has not been received from the originator of the information, or where the public interest in disclosure fails to outweigh the interests of the organisation or individual concerned. 14 s.2(1)(f) Box 6.0: Further advice and information How the Act and Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 6.32.
