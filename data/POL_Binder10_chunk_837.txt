Venue Plans Ð Primary suite L&D Force HQ Equality and Diversity Considerations An equality Impact Assessment has identified 2 areas of risk relating to protected Characteristics. The mitigations for each are listed after each area of risk:  Disability - there is no wheelchair access to the upper floors of L and D where the PIM suite is housed Mitigation Ð the training room on the ground floor and the trainerÕs office, also on the ground floor can be utilised in this scenario. The training room will become the KPW room and the trainerÕs office can be used for consultations with solicitors and staff association representatives for those staff that cannot use the stairs. There is access to toilets in this area  Gender reassignment and access to showering and toilet facilities. Mitigation Ð in order to maintain integrity of the process and to ensure there is no conferring, both changing rooms in the gym block would be commandeered by the PIM so that they could be used on an individual basis, which would render both changing rooms gender neutral for the purposes of the Post Incident Process. In relation to toilet facilities staff would also be using the facilities on a one at a time basis in order to maintain integrity and prevent conferring.
