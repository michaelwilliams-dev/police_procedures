forward to further detail in the Integrated Review in 2021. We are now living in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment in which global tech companies hold sway over national strategic advantages. By strengthening our ties with like- minded nations, the UK can increase our capabilities in co-creating technological developments, drawing innovations from oblique application areas and developing leading products which are then adopted by our allies. The broader AI community will be required to engage in this space as the security sector becomes more pervasive, and the government will need to find ways of working across demanding security frameworks to enable wider collaboration. Part of opening up wider collaboration on this front will require new levels of internationally competitive investment in advanced hardware technologies that serve the UK ecosystem, as the driving force behind fast and secure innovation. Co-creation Ð at scale Ð of technological developments in an application agnostic environment (benefiting from innovations from other application areas) could be a potential model. This would also provide additional benefits to improved technological export capabilities for Britain, and further benefits to attracting world-class technologists and innovators in this space, not seen in Britain since the 1980s.
