"reducing to writing": along and against the grain of a police inquiry As some authors have pointed out, we cannot mistake the inquiry for the police investigation (Misse, 2011; Vidal, 2013). The inquiry's main goal is to ascertain that a particular criminal action took place and to establish its author- ship. It is a "piece composed of technical reports, accounts recorded by a notary public and a legally-oriented re- port, signed by a police commissioner with a degree in Law" (Misse, 2011, p.19). It is also, however, an instrument through which the police investigative work is formalized and officialized6. As legal jargon puts it, "what isn't in the documents isn't in the world", so that an undocumented investigation is as if it had not existed. If the inquiry is the artifact through which the Federal Police's investigative and administrative actions become legi- ble and real before their own artificers, ethnographing these practices requires that one follows the paper. The initial idea was to approach these documents as a means to understanding the administrative rationalities responsible for constructing and managing the "human trafficking" crime and its respective social characters ("traffickers" and "trafficked persons"). This meant reading them along the grain. However, it gradually became clear that the process of producing, dislocating and fixing official and unofficial conceptions of "human trafficking" in police inquiries did not only depend on the performances of their multiple documenters, but also of the people being documented. In order to understand how the alleged "victims" of this crime construct "spaces of agency" (Piscitelli, 2013) within cer- tainly asymmetrical interactions with state apparatuses, one had to simultaneously read the inquiries against the grain. In this sense, the ethnography of "human trafficking" inquiries establishes a dialogue with other works that, in- stead of a "victimizing" perspective, suggest giving voice to the experiences of people who participate in these mo- bilities, making it possible to confront their narratives with hegemonic accounts about them (AgustÂ’n, 2005; Piscitel- li, 2008). Based on this confrontation, research has shown that these migrants' trajectories generally do not fit the myths and stereotypes disseminated by the media and anti-trafficking campaigns (Piscitelli, 2008; Teixeira; 2008; Blanchette e Silva, 2010). This suggestion is in line with the police perception of the phenomenon, so much so that they most often charac- terized "human trafficking" less in terms of its legal definition than based on a contrast with what they assumed "outsider" interlocutors (including the researcher) expected of this crime. Almost all federal police officers heard during the research began conversation by alerting the researcher that there were few inquiries on this crime. They seemed not to assign much relevance to the subject, partly because they considered the investigations fruitless. "Sometimes the investigation turns up nothing because, simply, there is nothing. Just because an inquiry was started does not mean that there is a crime", one commissioner points out. "There's plenty of revenge-hotline", according to the agents, who claim that people use the Public Security Office's "Crime-hotline" in order to
