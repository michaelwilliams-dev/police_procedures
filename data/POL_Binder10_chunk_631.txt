IM & A to the SIRO and disseminated to IAO. Control of information risk will be carried out using an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with applicable standards and community of trust governance and information risk baseline requirements. IAO will have some discretion over how to demonstrate compliance although in the majority of areas, a specific approach will be mandated. Security Classification, Personnel Security, Physical Security and Business Continuity are governed by separate policies and guidance as outlined in Chapter 3. Business models and business plans will take account of information risk assessments. Measuring performance and providing assurance Ð Wiltshire Police will:  Measure and improve information risk management culture using the Community of Trust GIRR  Report risks quarterly in response to legislative and regulatory body requirements  Audit the implementation of this and complementary security policies at least annually and make a public statement about the quality of our system of internal control  Report incidents in accordance with Cabinet Office, Home Office and local requirements as outlined at Annex E  Ensure that all mission critical Information Systems (IS) handling Classified or otherwise sensitive information (personal data for example) will be ÔAssuredÕ in accordance with applicable HMG Standards and ÔReassuredÕ when the threats and or risks change or when the system undergoes significant change or at least every 5 years for Official, every 3 years for Official-Sensitive and annually for Secret.

Official-Sensitive Ð Cautious (Preference for safe options that have a low degree of residual risk and may only have limited potential for reward).
