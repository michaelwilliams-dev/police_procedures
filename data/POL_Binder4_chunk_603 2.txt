A âpre-commencement matterâ means a matter whichâ is a complaint or a conduct matter, relates to conduct which took place, or circumstances which occurred, before 1 April 2004, and (apart from this section) is prevented by a relevant transitional provision from being recorded under this Part as a complaint or a conduct matter. âRelevant transitional provisionâ means article 2, 3 or 4 of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (Transitional Provisions) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/671).
