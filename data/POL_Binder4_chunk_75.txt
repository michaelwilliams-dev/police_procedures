would facilitate family access to local, high-quality, culturally and linguistically responsive care, available even during non- traditional hours. Mixed-delivery has demonstrated to meet these goals. A report by the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation found that the stateâs mixed-delivery program successfully increased the accessibility of high-quality ECCE, particularly for low-income families.15 The study also found that the mixed-delivery programâs investment in ECCE providers enabled them to bolster program quality. Additionally, Colorado has mandated a family childcare inclusive mixed-delivery system for their universal pre-K program in order to prevent the loss of providers and consequent increase in costs and decrease in availability; leverage all existing childcare facilities to maximize accessibility; prioritize familial choice; and account for the diverse needs of distinct communities. The state has already seen success for these initiatives in Denver and Summit County.16 Enabling family childcare providers to access additional funding, such as that obtained through inclusion in preschool subsidization programs, has been demonstrated to prevent closures. In Minnesota, access to Child Care Stabilization Grants through the American Rescue Plan decreased the risk of family childcare provider closure â just 5% of providers who received funding closed during the pandemic, as opposed to 26% of providers who did not.17 This illustrates that the loss of FCC providers is rooted in inadequate funding, rather than disinterest in the field. For underappreciated childcare providers, particularly those responsible for FCC, this mixed-delivery model would denote them as a legitimate facet of the childcare team. It would enable them to maintain financial viability by preventing the loss of profitable three- and four-year-old children, preserving the jobs of a group disproportionately composed of racial and ethnic minority women.18 Highlights The implementation of public pre-K programs nationwide is putting private childcare providers out of business, exacerbating the lack of availability and affordability within the childcare market.4 To resolve this issue, public pre-K should be subsidized through mixed-delivery systems, which fund preschool programs in many settings, including public schools, center-based care, Head Start programs, religious centers, and family or home-based childcare.11 Mixed-delivery systems provide parents with the agency to choose between a range of preschool options, enabling access to high- quality, local, culturally and linguistically appropriate care, available during non- traditional hours.16 A mixed-delivery pre-K system is feasible due to bipartisan support, successful examples across the nation, and its efficient use of pre-existing childcare infrastructure.20, 21, 6 Implementation Due to high bipartisan support for the measure, the implementation of mixed-delivery funding for subsidized pre-K is very feasible.19 This ability to generate bipartisan support was exemplified during the 2024 vice presidential debate, in which both candidates supported a mixed-delivery system in order to strengthen parent choice in childcare.20 Additionally, as mixed-delivery pre-K utilizes pre- existing infrastructure, implementation is time- and cost- efficient.6 When implementing a mixed-delivery model, states should look to the models provided by previously established systems. Successful examples of mixed- delivery include Washingtonâs Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, North Carolinaâs Smart Start Network, and West Virginiaâs WV pre-K.21 The methods adopted by these states
