interviews should be planned and conducted as thoroughly as they would for a suspect under arrest including:  The explanation of the reason for the interview to be given to the suspect, ensuring no questioning about the offence is conducted outside of the formal interview;  The explanation of why arrest is not considered necessary, ensuring there is no suggestion of coercion or misunderstanding that could lead to allegations of oppression or unfairness;   The arrangements for obtaining legal advice;  Identifying any vulnerability and facilitating any special requirements for the interview which would be considered if the suspect was under arrest, such as the use of an appropriate adult or an interpreter;  Identifying the purpose of the interview with clear aims and objectives, these are an important point of reference should the suspect later withdraw their consent to be interviewed;  Carefully planning the interview with a comprehensive strategy and a planned release of information that will assist the process. Decisions on what evidence and/or information to give to the suspect and their legal advisor before interview are still relevant to voluntary attendance. Information Supplied to the Suspect While balancing the need to supply sufficient information for a person to make an informed decision, when arranging a voluntary interview investigators must confine themselves to a factual exchange of information and avoid entering into a dialogue which could be construed as coercive or an interview outside the safeguards of PACE. Answering questions about the logistics and practicalities of the proposed interview does not amount to questioning for the purpose of ascertaining the personÕs involvement or suspected involvement in the offence but asking questions about the evidence would amount to questioning for such a purpose. Suspects should be informed:  Of the nature of the alleged offence including when and where it was committed;  That to properly investigate their suspected involvement they must be interviewed under caution;   That, in the circumstances, their arrest may not be necessary if they attend at the police station voluntarily to be interviewed;  That if they attend voluntarily they will be entitled to free legal advice before the interview and to have a solicitor present during the interview;  The date and time of the interview will take account of their circumstances and the needs of the investigation; and  If they do not agree to attend voluntarily at a time which meets the needs of the investigation, or having so agreed they fail to attend, or having attended they fail to remain for the interview to be completed, their arrest may be necessary to enable them to be interviewed. Information supplied to the person on the reasons for the interview must be sufficient for them to make an informed decision and should be consistent with what would be supplied to a person on arrest. This does not, however, extend to supplying detailed information about the investigation that has given rise to the reasonable suspicion.1 Legal Advice A person interviewed
