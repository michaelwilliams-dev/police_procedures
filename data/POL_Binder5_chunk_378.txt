are considered acceptable.  If the shot placement rules are not adhered to, the armour is not perforated and the BFS is within the defined limits; this may be classed as a fair strike upon acceptance 16 Assessed on the last layer (body side) of ballistic material within the panel construction. 17 It is assumed that the shot is perpendicular if the barrel is perpendicular to the target. If the manufacturer wishes to assess yaw, they may request this to be conducted at their own cost. by the manufacturer. Beyond this point, any subsequent fair strikes are considered acceptable. Any strikes that do not meet the fair strike criteria and are not covered by the exceptions shall be recorded as unfair. If an unfair strike is recorded another shot location that complies with the shot placement rules shall be identified by the test facility and an additional shot shall be placed in this location. A maximum of seven shots shall be taken on unformed medium/large protective panels and a maximum of four shots shall be taken on unformed small panels in a test series. No additional strikes may be conducted on formed panels. If there is an unfair strike, an additional formed armour panel shall be provided for testing. 6.1.4. Shot placement rules Shots shall be placed in accordance with shot patterns defined in Section 6.4.2. In all circumstances the shot placement rules in Table 7 shall be adhered to. The reference point for these distances is the edge of a shot entry hole.
