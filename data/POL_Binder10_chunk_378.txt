The following table is illustrative of the structure and type of content that is included in the Local Risk Assessment Guidance (LRAG). It identifies the types of hazard that Category 1 responders may wish to add to their Community Risk Registers, and an assessment of the likelihood of these risks occurring in a five- year timeframe in a typical Local Resilience Forum (LRF) area. It also sets out the assumptions which underpin the likelihood assessment and guidance on how this might vary through the country. It also provides information on generic threats for Category 1 responders. Category 1 responders are collectively responsible for maintaining a Community Risk Register (CRR). The LRAG is a guide which should assist Category 1 responders in compiling and assessing their CRRs. It provides a consistent basis for emergency planning across the LRF area. For each risk, the following descriptors are provided: o Risk identifier: Risks prefixed with ÔHÕ are hazards which will require a national as well as a local response. Risks marked ÔHLÕ would not ordinarily prompt a national response, and would usually be dealt with locally. Risks marked ÔTÕ are threats which will require a national as well as a local response. o Risk category: This indicates the type of threat or hazard in question (e.g. terrorist attack, industrial accident, severe weather, public protests). Risk categories should be read in conjunction with outcome descriptions in order to understand the magnitude of the event. o o Outcome description: This describes the immediate consequences or significance of the event. Outcome descriptions will often be expressed
