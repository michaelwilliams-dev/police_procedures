section 1 of the 1968 Act to firearms that have the appearance of being a firearm to which section 1 of the 1968 Act (firearms requiring a firearm certificate) applies, and it is so constructed or adapted as to be readily convertible into a firearm to which that section applies. Carrying a firearm or imitation with criminal intent (section 18 of the 1968 Act) 21.10 Section 18(1) of the 1968 Act makes it an offence for a person to have with them a firearm or imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence or to resist arrest or prevent the arrest of someone else while they have it with them. 21.11 Section 18(3) provides that in Scotland, Òindictable offenceÓ means any offence specified in paragraphs 1-18 of Schedule 2 to the 1968 Act. It should be noted that the definition of Òindictable offenceÓ in section 57(4) of the 1968 Act was omitted by the Criminal Law Act 1977 schedule 13. The Interpretation Act 1978 states in Schedule 1 that, in relation to England and Wales, Òindictable offenceÓ means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable on indictment, whether it is exclusively so triable or triable either way. 21.12 In order to prove an offence under section 18(1) of the 1968 Act, it is necessary to show that: a. the accused had a firearm or imitation firearm with them; and b. they intended to commit an indictable offence or to resist arrest or prevent the arrest of another, as the case may be. 21.13 Section 18(2) of the 1968 Act provides that if (a) and (b) are proved, that shall be evidence of an intention to have the weapon with them at the time of committing the offence or of resisting or preventing the arrest which can be displaced by evidence to the contrary. 21.14 Section 18 of the 1968 Act covers all types of firearms, including shot guns, air weapons and imitation firearms. It should be noted that an air weapon must be sufficiently powerful to be defined as a lethal barrelled weapon. Carrying firearms in a public place (section 19 of the 1968 Act) 21.15 Section 19 of the 1968 Act makes it an offence to have in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse (the proof of which lies on the accused) a loaded shot gun, an air weapon (whether loaded or not), any other firearm (whether loaded or not) together with ammunition suitable for use in that firearm, or an imitation firearm. 21.16 Section 57(6) of the 1968 Act includes a definition of ÒloadedÓ in relation to shot guns and air weapons. An air weapon is to be treated as loaded if there is 177 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law ammunition in the chamber or barrel or in any magazine or other device which is in such a position that the ammunition can be fed into the chamber or barrel by the manual or automatic operation of some part of the
