e.g. PND, PNC, ChildrenÕs Social Care;  submit an appropriate intelligence log;  complete relevant risk assessment and management plans (as per Force Policy);  refer to local authority childrenÕs social care (unless they were the referrer).  complete a crime report, ensuring that the incident is flagged in accordance with force procedures;  inform their supervisor, who must be at least the rank of inspector;  ensure that the on-call superintendent is made aware of the referral;  create a crime report/non-crime related occurrence to record the report/referral; 58 | Multi-agency statutory guidance on female genital mutilation Police: Additional Considerations  if the report is made under the mandatory reporting duty (see Section 3.4) it must be recorded as a crime without delay or waiting for further investigation (unless there is immediately available credible evidence to show that a crime has not occurred). This includes cases where it is suspected that FGM occurred outside of England and Wales.  all officers and staff must treat this crime as a critical incident and deal with the matter effectively;  the investigative strategy should consider obtaining evidence or intelligence identifying the cutters (people who carry out FGM for payment or otherwise) and investigating these individuals with a view to identifying further victims and closing down such networks; and  investigating officers must refer to the Police/Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) Protocol for the investigation and prosecution of FGM cases.
