PE industry maximizes shareholder value while simultaneously contributing to social welfare. Highlight:  This policy proposes that through an expansion of Section 1042 of the IRC, private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) firms can defer capital gains taxes by selling a controlling stake in a company to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP) and reinvesting the proceedings into a QRP from an operating corporation that is an SME with ESG initiatives as defined under this law.6  This policy also encourages reinvestment into SMEs with specific ESG initiatives, increasing their influence in their respective industries to expand their social and environmental welfare impact.13,14  This policy will use the existing compliance frameworks for Section 1042 with adjustments to account for the QRP differences, documenting both the sale to ESOPs and the reinvestment in ESG- compliant QRPs. The IRS would partner with the Department of Labor to ensure all ESOP transactions meet ERISA standards.15,16 Implementation First, the United States Congress will need to introduce and pass a bill through both chambers, proposing amendments to Section 1042 of the IRC to allow private equity and venture capital firms holding a controlling stake in a company to defer capital gains taxes when selling to an ESOP. Within this bill, Congress must define controlling stake as at least 30%, QRP as any security issued by a domestic Òoperating corporation,Ó SMEs as firms that employ fewer than 500 employees, and ESG as a metric used in business and investing to determine a companyÕs performance across multiple areas of social responsibility like environment, social, and corporate governance.6,13,14 ESOPs must be defined as a qualified defined contribution plan that is a stock bonus plan or a stock bonus/money purchase plan under IRC Section 401(a).17 These terms are important to define during the legislative process to ensure that the true meaning of the bill is held, especially with potential legal scrutiny.18 Assuming the passage of the bill in both chambers of Congress and the signing of the bill by the President of the United States, the IRS will have jurisdiction in enforcing the law. Prior to enforcement, the IRS will open a Public Notice and Comment Period to receive stakeholder input. Inputs have successfully led to the more effective and efficient enforcement of laws, as seen with the IRS Qualified Business Income Deduction in 2018 and its clarified definitions after the comments.19 To ensure compliance, the IRS will establish a framework to enforce the new tax code similar to the current compliance framework under Section 1042 of the IRC, with a few additional adjustments. Sellers must attach a written statement indicating their choice to apply for Section 1042 to their income tax return for the year of the sale.20 This statement must include the following: a description of the corporation or qualified securities sold, the date of sale, the cost of the QRP purchased, and a justification for why the QRP is considered a part of an SME that can be measured under ESG standards.20 Within 45 days
