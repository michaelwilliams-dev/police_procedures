Restoring ASEAN Principles: Why Expelling Myanmar Could End the Juntaâs Oppressive Reign By Naina Kalra, nk599@cornell.edu The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) must suspend Myanmarâs membership to uphold its commitment to human rights and regional stability, leveraging economic exclusion and a coordinated arms embargo to pressure the junta into halting violence against the Rohingya population. Background The ongoing military juntaâs persecution of the Rohingya people is a grim illustration of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. In 1974, Myanmarâs military government, led by a Buddhist nationalist group, revoked the citizenship of the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority group.1 Over the past 50 years, the Rohingya have endured relentless violence, including the burning of villages, sexual violence, mass killings, and loss of rights.1 This persecution peaked in 2017, when military-led violence forced over 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, leaving 9,000 dead.1 Despite the Rome Statute from the International Criminal Court requiring countries to prevent and address genocide, and the United Nations labeling the Rohingya crisis as genocide, ASEANâs response has been unacceptably poor.2,3,4 ASEANâs mission emphasizes promoting peace and upholding the rules and standards of the United Nations.5 However, ASEANâs failure to effectively address Myanmarâs atrocities has violated these core principles. While ASEAN barred Myanmar from participation in certain summits and signed a five-point consensus with Myanmar in 2021 to end violence, Myanmar has continued its violent repression.6 Currently, 914,000 Rohingya live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh with no path to citizenship.1 Another 630,000 remain in Myanmar in extreme danger and are unable to escape to Bangladesh, which has forcibly returned 6,000 Rohingya since August 5, unable to support the refugees.7 If decisive action is not taken now, this entire ethnic group risks losing their homeland and chance to preserve their identity. ASEANâs failure to expel Myanmar reflects their deep economic ties with Singapore-based companies that supplied Myanmar with $254 million in arms between 2021 and 2022, placing ASEAN members among the top arms providers to Myanmarâs junta.8 Allowing Myanmar to resume participation in ASEAN summits signals that ASEAN tolerates human rights abuses.9 Expelling Myanmar from ASEAN is an essential prerequisite to ending the authoritarian regime in Myanmar. Policy Idea Given Myanmarâs failure to adhere to ASEANâs five-point consensus â particularly its disregard for the ceasefire agreement, commitment to peaceful resolution, and worsening human rights abuses against the Rohingya people â ASEAN should suspend Myanmarâs membership.6 This suspension aligns with ASEANâs foundational principles of mutual respect, peaceful cooperation, and human rights and serves as a crucial step
