PURPOSE, PRINCIPLES & SCOPE OF THE DISCIPLINE PROCEDURE 1.1 Purpose & Scope Standards of conduct and performance are required in any organisation to ensure order, the effective operation of the business and a safe and healthy working environment. In the Police Service expectations of conduct and performance standards are high, and reasonably so as a consequence of the type of work we do, the access we have to privileged and often sensitive information, and the issues that we can be required to deal with, within our day to day business. Public confidence in all members of the Police Service is vital. Conduct that may damage this is a risk to the organisation. This discipline procedure is the means by which the standards of reasonable behaviour for police staff within the Organisation are communicated and maintained. The National Police Code of Ethics has been adopted by the Organisation to establish clear standards and expectations (see Appendix 2). Action under this procedure should not be seen solely as a means of applying sanctions but also as a means of encouraging learning and improvement in unacceptable behaviour and conduct. 1.2 Legislative Compliance This document has been drafted to comply with the principles of the Human Rights Act. Proportionality has been identified as the key to Human Rights compliance, this means striking a fair balance between the rights of the individual and those of the rest of the community. There must be a reasonable relationship between the aim to be achieved and the means used. Equality and Diversity issues have also been considered to ensure compliance with the Equality Act 2010 and meet the Organisation√ïs legal obligation in relation to the equality duty. In addition, Data Protection, Freedom of Information and Health and Safety Issues have been considered. Adherence to this procedure will therefore ensure compliance with all relevant legislation and internal policies. This procedure is published on the Human Resources Intranet site (on firstpoint) and it is the responsibility of all police staff and line managers to make themselves aware of its content and to ensure it is applied consistently.
