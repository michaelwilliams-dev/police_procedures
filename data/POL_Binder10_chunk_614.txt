Regulation 13(5)(a) of CIR 2013 allows for a representative of the chief officer of police to be present during a forensic post mortem examination. In such cases, a forensic pathologist on the Home Office Register of Forensic Pathologists should be appointed to conduct the post mortem examination. The Home Office registered forensic pathologist will conduct a post mortem examination in accordance with the Code of Practice and Performance Standards for Forensic Pathology.
