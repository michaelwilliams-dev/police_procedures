POLICY STATEMENT The 2020 NCA National Strategic Assessment identifies 'financial hardship' as a corruption risk to police officers and staff. While it is accepted that an individual employee of Wiltshire Police may be burdened with unmanageable debt through little or no fault of their own, unmanageable debt / borrowing can make members of the Police service vulnerable / susceptible to improper influence or undue pressure, fraud, blackmail or extortion by criminal individuals or groups. This policy highlights the requirement for Police Officers to discharge all lawful debts in accordance with the terms and conditions directed by the lender and sets the same standards on unmanageable debt to all Police Staff, Special Constabulary and embedded 3rd party representatives. 2. AIM OF THE POLICY This policy is intended to reassure all members of Wiltshire Police that should they get into financial difficulty they will receive support from the Force and signposting to appropriate support agencies if required. However, to receive the support from the force, the individual must understand their personal responsibility to disclose (see s4.1 below). All members of Wiltshire Police should be aware that indebtedness and unmanageable borrowing can pose a risk to the integrity of individual members of Wiltshire Police. In some instances individuals may become vulnerable to corruption. Any undue pressure, improper influence or manipulation of Wiltshire Police employees by criminal individuals and organisations could cause significant damage to
