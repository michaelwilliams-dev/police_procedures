Unformed armour, submitted for stab ILM, shall be conducted on a single unformed protective panel assessed against the criteria outlined in Section 10.6.1. Formed armour ILM stab testing shall be conducted on a single formed front panel and assessed against the criteria outlined in Section 10.6.2. As with ballistic testing, for unformed armour, these panels shall be the largest available that meet the sampling criteria. Formed armour shall be submitted with consideration given to the sizes of female-shaped torso mannequins (Section 4.3.1). ILM shall be conducted in accordance with the methods and assessment criteria for the respective tests outlined in PQT (Section 10). If PQT requirements are not met an investigation shall commence in accordance with Section 10.9. Additional operational armour may be required for assessment. 42 Formed armour shall be assessed through associated unformed armours in a CPA test. 43 Plates shall be supplied with associated soft armour submitted in certification.
