without the need for a court order or to give them prior notice that an application is to be made. The giving of prior notice of an application may mean that a respondent is ready to comply and allows them the opportunity to make representations about the detail of the order or notice due to the nature of the investigation or what they will be required to produce. In all cases, those exercising the powers must exercise them fairly, courteously, responsibly, respectfully and without discrimination. Under section 149 of the Equality Act 2010, when the relevant Director, their authorised staff or a specified person are carrying out their functions, they also have a duty to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation, to advance equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant Òprotected characteristicÓ and those who do not share it, and to take steps to foster good relations between those persons.9 18.

They must also have regard to the desirability of promoting good relations between persons of different religious belief, political opinion or racial group. 19. The appropriate officer (in the case of an application for a warrant) or appropriate person (in the case of execution of a warrant) should also consider whether this consultation could jeopardize an ongoing (sensitive) wider operation or investigation. In such circumstances consultation may not be advisable. 20. The expectation is that the provisions of the Code will apply to all searches carried out under this Code. 21. A refusal to allow a search of premises or a vehicle may in some instances constitute an offence, (including but not limited to) of wilful obstruction of an appropriate officer in the exercise of a power10. This would be a criminal matter and is not an issue for, or subject to, this Code. Appropriate officers should be aware of other legislation and codes applicable in these circumstances. 22.
