We are already taking steps to deliver improvements in safeguarding and child protection which we expect will bring real benefits to children. We also recognise that there are more steps we can take to enhance the likelihood of abuse and neglect being recognised and reported at an earlier point so that the appropriate action can be taken. 29. We will address directly the issues raised by the consultation through a combination of these ongoing reforms and the following programme of action. To ensure there is strong awareness of the risks and need to report abuse, we are: 30. Launching a further phase of our communications campaign, Together, we can tackle child abuse. The third phase of the campaign continues to raise awareness, improve understanding and normalise reporting behaviour in communities so that more children can be kept safe from harm.

The Department for Education has conducted a thorough engagement process on the scope and content of Relationships Education and RSE, including further consideration of PSHE. This process involved engagement with stakeholders and
