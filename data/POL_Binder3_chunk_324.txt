bottom 50% holds only 2.5%.1  Access to public transportation has proven to be a powerful tool for reducing poverty, enabling individuals to reach job opportunities quickly and efficiently.5  Affordability remains a significant barrier, as approximately 30% of impoverished people struggle to afford public transportation.8  The city government of Boston implemented a 50% fare reduction program for low-income residents in the summer of 2024, which is expected to increase low- income ridership by 30%.16  In order to address this problem, the New York City Government should expand their current Fair Fares program to those living at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, giving them half-price fares on all MTA subways and non-express buses. Implementation The Office of NYC Councilwoman Selvena Brooks- Powers should sponsor the bill for this policy in the NYC Council, which would most likely pass due to the tendency of NYC residents and the City Council to support socially liberal policies such as this one. Councilwoman Brooks-Powers brings valuable experience in directing infrastructure funding and currently serves as the Chair of the Committee of Transportation and Infrastructure.17 Given their history of endorsing public transit improvements, advocacy organizations, including Transportation for America and the American Public Transportation Association, would also support the proposal by lobbying other NYC councilmembers.18, 19 The NYC Council would work closely with the MTA to administer and oversee the expanded program. The main challenge to implementing this expansion is the $3.495 billion in lost fares.12 Although the congestion tax hike would fully cover any lost fare revenue associated with the proposed Fair Fares expansion, only $255 million remain per year for any subway and bus upgrades.12, 14 The MTA can apply for government subsidies from President BidenÕs Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocated $8 billion to expand high-capacity rail and bus services in states across the US.20 If federal funding falls through, the MTA can also increase revenue by combatting fare evasion. The MTA can station more officials in high-traffic subway and bus stations to discourage potential fare evaders.21 Although there would be an associated personnel cost, the increased revenue would be significant, given that fare evasion affects 14% of subway and 48% of bus rides in New York City.22, 23 Administrative adjustments associated with special MetroCards could be combated by utilizing infrastructure from the existing Fair Fares program, using any of the aforementioned funding sources to cover the costs associated with program expansion, including personnel and administrative costs. Limited publicity was another issue with the original Fair Fares program. To address this, the MTA will partner with community organizations to significantly publicize Fair Fares. The campaign will include posters and advertisements in low-income neighborhoods and public housing projects. Publicity would cost roughly $75-150 per advertisement, which could be covered by the 4 to 1 economic return increased public transportation provides.24, 25 The MTA will also put advertisements on buses and subways, directly reaching eligible riders. To gather community feedback, the MTA will collaborate with community-based organizations in low-income communities
