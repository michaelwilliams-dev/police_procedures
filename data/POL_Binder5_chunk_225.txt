If the person refuses to hand over a firearm or ammunition when required to do so, they commit an offence and a power of arrest arises, as explained below. 22.8 The powers to detain, search and enter in section 47 of the 1968 Act are similarly intended to enable a police officer to determine whether an offence has been committed and to take immediate and effective action.
