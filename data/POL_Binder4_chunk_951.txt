Additionally, there were only three organisations (with 21 bed spaces) dedicated for women with substance use support needs or complex needs.131 Similarly, alcohol treatment services may not be sufficiently well- equipped to treat women who have experienced domestic abuse. A mapping exercise led by Against Violence and Abuse (AVA) found that women-only provisions of substance use services are available in less than half of local authorities in England and Wales.132 Furthermore, services typically address single issues, such as substance use or mental health which can see women being passed around services or unable to access holistic support. There can also be variations and gaps in service provision for certain groups.
