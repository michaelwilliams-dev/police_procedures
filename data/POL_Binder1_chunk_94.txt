See Annex C for more information on talking about FGM with those affected. Medical examinations Corroborative evidence should be sought through a medical examination conducted by a qualified medical professional trained in identifying the different types of FGM. In all cases involving children, an experienced paediatrician should be involved in setting up the medical examination. This is to ensure that a holistic assessment which explores any other medical, support and safeguarding needs of the girl or young woman is offered and that appropriate referrals are made as necessary. Steps when an adult has had FGM If any police officer or police staff is made aware that an adult woman has undergone FGM, a multi-agency disciplinary approach must be taken to consider the risks to the woman. This should consider any potential risk to any girls within the family (and extended family) and consider initial and core assessments of those girls. Consideration should also be given to providing supportive services for the woman, including counselling and medical assistance and signposting the FGM survivor to specialist non-governmental organisation support networks. The investigative strategy should consider obtaining evidence or intelligence identifying the excisors (people who carry out FGM for payment or otherwise) and investigating these individuals with a view to identifying further victims and closing down such networks. Investigating officers must consult early with the CPS in all FGM cases - as per the police/CPS protocol so the most effective investigation and prosecution opportunities are identified. Further advice on progressing an investigation can be found online on the Authorised Professional Practice (APP) website (www.app.college.police.uk). 60 | Multi-agency statutory guidance on female genital mutilation School, Colleges and Universities: Additional Considerations D.2.11 School, Colleges and Universities: Additional Considerations The statutory duties on schools and colleges are set out in ÔWorking Together to Safeguard ChildrenÕ60(for England) and ÔKeeping Children Safe in EducationÕ61 or ÔKeeping Learners SafeÕ62 in Wales.
