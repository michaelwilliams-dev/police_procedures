Assent on 12 February 2015. 81. However, in the case of the section 1 and 6 offences, the extra-territoriality is limited in that it only applies insofar as those offences are committed in relation to the commission, preparation, or instigation of one or more ÒConvention offencesÓ. ÒConvention offencesÓ are those to which Council of Europe Member States are required to extend extra-territorial jurisdiction as a result of Article 14 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (May 2005); the relevant offences are set out in Schedule 1 to the 2006 Act. In the case of the section 5 offence, there was no previous extra-territorial jurisdiction. 82. Section 81 of the 2015 Act amends section 17(2) of the 2006 Act to provide for extra-territorial jurisdiction for the section 5 offence and to extend the existing extra-territorial jurisdiction of the section 6 offence. As a result, a person who does anything outside of the UK which would constitute an offence under section 5 or 6 (whether in relation to a Convention offence or terrorism more widely) could be tried in the UK courts were they to return to this country. 1.
