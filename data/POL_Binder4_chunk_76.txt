is time- and cost- efficient.6 When implementing a mixed-delivery model, states should look to the models provided by previously established systems. Successful examples of mixed- delivery include Washingtonâs Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program, North Carolinaâs Smart Start Network, and West Virginiaâs WV pre-K.21 The methods adopted by these states vary, and those considering implementation should determine which model would work best for them by performing a comparative analysis of their demographics, political ideologies, and the availability of funding as compared to example states. Next, states should develop a clear and comprehensive legislative framework defining their mixed- delivery model, outlining eligibility criteria, funding mechanisms, and quality standards. States should ensure that both center- and home- based childcare providers are eligible for funding, ensuring the financial viability of FCC providers. As subsidization is chronically underutilized by FCC providers even when technically available, states should develop a mechanism for clearly communicating the funding opportunities available to these providers, and create a program to help assist them with the paperwork necessary for participating. Once the mixed- delivery model is established, the state should put a robust monitoring and evaluation system in place to assess the systemâs effectiveness and address any issues that may materialize. This system ought to measure and analyze enrollment numbers, child outcomes, and provider and family satisfaction, enabling the state to make adjustments to the program accordingly. States should implement mixed-delivery pre-K systems immediately. Until a change to the childcare landscape is made, providers will continue to go out of business, and families will continue to lose essential childcare services.
