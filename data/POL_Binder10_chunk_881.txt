criminal investigations are facilitated in line with the Victims Code of Practice through Horizon.  2.11 Calls to Control Room/FDU asking for Incident/Occurrence Numbers When a member of the public calls up for basic information such as an incident or crime number; providing you are satisfied that they are the person entitled to the information (possibly by asking them to verify basic details as recorded on the incident such as their name and date of birth, or the location of incident), it is appropriate to pass the incident number or Niche Occurrence number only. 2.12 Enforced Right of Access Requests Certain employers and organisations such as recruitment agencies may attempt to exploit the subject access process by requiring individuals to use it to obtain a copy of their criminal convictions (or evidence that there is nothing held) as part of recruitment or continuing employment processes. This process, known as enforced subject access, is legislated through Part 7 section 184 of the Data Protection Act 2018.

You must bear in mind that it is the right of the child rather than of anyone else, such as a parent or guardian. So it is the child who has a right of access to the information held about them, even though in the case of young children these rights are likely to be exercised by those with parental responsibility for them. Before responding to a Right of Access Request for information held about a child, you should consider whether the child is mature enough to understand their rights. If you are confident that the child can understand their rights, then you should usually respond directly to the child. You may, however, allow the parent to exercise the childÕs rights on their behalf if the child authorises this, or if it is evident that this is in the
