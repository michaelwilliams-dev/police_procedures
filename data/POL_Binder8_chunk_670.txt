Base: 318 responses to this question. Note: percentages are calculated by dividing the response count for each code by the number of respondents (318) and will not add up to 100%. 20 89. Respondents suggested that the main benefit of a duty to act would be safer, more robust processes (8%). 90. The main additional risks identified by respondents were that a duty to act would not recognise the complicated judgements required by practitioners (23%) and that it would increase pressure on resources (21%). 91. The written submissions we received identified the main benefits as improved professional standards as well as safer, more robust processes. The main risks were that a duty to act would not recognise the complicated judgements required by practitioners and a fear of being reported for not acting. RespondentsÕ preferred approach 92.
