Office for National Statistics (ons.gov.uk): 1.1 Domestic homicide: Data from 2017-2019. Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance In the definition person âAâ refers to the perpetrator of the abuse, and person âBâ refers to the victim of the abuse. The term âvictimâ is used in the 2021 Act to denote someone who has experienced domestic abuse. This includes children who have seen, heard, or experienced the effects of domestic abuse, and are related to either the victim of the abusive behaviour, or the perpetrator (section 3 of the 2021 Act). Section 1(3) of the 2021 Act provides for what constitutes behaviour that is abusive. This behaviour might consist of a single incident or a course of conduct. Section 1(3)(c) refers to controlling or coercive behaviour. This behaviour might amount to an offence under section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015. In order for the offence to be committed the behaviour must satisfy the test set out in section 76(1), this means it must be repeated or continuous and that the other elements of the criminal offence in the section must be made out. Section 1(5) provides that, for the purposes of the 2021 Act, Aâs behaviour may be behaviour âtowardsâ B despite the fact that it consists of conduct directed at another person â for example Bâs child, other family member, friend or colleague. Section 2 of the 2021 Act provides the definition of âpersonally connectedâ and this includes those who would constitute a ârelativeâ of the victim. The definition of ârelativeâ has the meaning given under section 63(1) of the Family Law Act 1996 (âthe 1996 Actâ) which includes immediate biological family, stepfamily and extended family of an individual including such family members of their present or former spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner. âAâ and âBâ do not need to be living together, or co-habiting, to be âpersonally connectedâ under the 2021 Act. Section 2(3) of the 2021 Act, for the purposes of the definition of âpersonally connectedâ, defines a âchildâ as a person under the age of 18 years. This will include a person aged 16 or 17. Section 3 provides that a child (a person under the age of 18 years), is for the purposes of the 2021 Act, recognised as a victim of domestic abuse if they see, hear, or experience the effects of the abuse, and is related to âAâ or âBâ. The 2021 Act does not create a single criminal offence of domestic abuse, and frontline responders should continue to consider the full range of existing legislation and safeguards to protect children. Offences to be considered could include common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and causing, or allowing, death or serious harm, or child cruelty, neglect, and violence. This last offence, under section 1 of the Children and Young Person Act 193314 was amended in 2015, to include causing a child emotional or psychological suffering, including through exposure to domestic abuse. Pursuant to section 31(9) of the Children Act 1989 âharmâ
