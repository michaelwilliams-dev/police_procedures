Local governments should implement shared appreciation mortgage programs to combat the crisis. Background The current state of homeownership in the United States presents several challenges. According to the U.S. Census Bureauâs Housing Vacancies and Homeownership Survey, the homeownership rate in the second quarter of 2024 was 65.6%, falling below the 25-year average of 66.4%, marking the lowest rate in the past two years.1 This decline is particularly concerning for younger Americans, who find it increasingly difficult to purchase homes. For individuals below the age of 35, the homeownership rate for the head of households fell to 37.4%, the lowest figure in four years.1 This is primarily due to stricter lending practices and credit standards following the Great Recession.2 Young adults lacking robust financial stability are unable to purchase homes. In addition, home prices have risen considerably in the past decade, which has made homeownership increasingly unaffordable.2 Racial disparities further complicate homeownership. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 74.3% of White individuals are homeowners, whereas 45.7% of Black people, 49.5% of Hispanic individuals, and 62.3% of Asian individuals are homeowners.3 Minority groups consistently face lower homeownership rates compared to their White counterparts, and homes owned by minority groups tend to have lower appraisal values.3 These disparities are rooted in a long history of racial discrimination in the housing market, dating back to the early 20th century when exclusionary behavior such as redlining was commonplace.4 Municipalities across the country must address this via public policy to ensure a more equitable housing market going forward. Shared appreciation mortgages can make homeownership more accessible to those who need it the most. Policy Idea Local governments across the United States should leverage both federal and state funds to establish shared appreciation mortgage programs. It is ideal for local governments to tackle this issue, as there tends to be extensive variation in housing policies by state and locality. Shared appreciation mortgages, or loans, are typically structured as deferred loans.5 They are interest-free, with repayment deferred until the
