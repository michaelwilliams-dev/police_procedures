Background The ongoing military juntaÕs persecution of the Rohingya people is a grim illustration of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. In 1974, MyanmarÕs military government, led by a Buddhist nationalist group, revoked the citizenship of the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority group.1 Over the past 50 years, the Rohingya have endured relentless violence, including the burning of villages, sexual violence, mass killings, and loss of rights.1 This persecution peaked in 2017, when military-led violence forced over 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, leaving 9,000 dead.1 Despite the Rome Statute from the International Criminal Court requiring countries to prevent and address genocide, and the United Nations labeling the Rohingya crisis as genocide, ASEANÕs response has been unacceptably poor.2,3,4 ASEANÕs mission emphasizes promoting peace and upholding the rules and standards of the United Nations.5 However, ASEANÕs failure to effectively address MyanmarÕs atrocities has violated these core principles. While ASEAN barred Myanmar from participation in certain summits and signed a five-point consensus with Myanmar in 2021 to end violence, Myanmar has continued its violent repression.6 Currently, 914,000 Rohingya live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh with no path to citizenship.1 Another 630,000 remain in Myanmar in extreme danger and are unable to escape to Bangladesh, which has forcibly returned 6,000
