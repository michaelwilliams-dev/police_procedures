state through rate-payer funding. Utility companies collect money from customers' monthly electricity bills to support various state energy programs. Unlike in the broader funding for the NY Sun Act, this projectÕs budget would be managed by NY Ag and Markets, in addition to NYSERDA. The project would also rely on public-private partnerships with energy companies that own the solar array sites. The policy would result in increased relationships between agricultural producers and energy companies. Legislators should view this act as a way to conserve agriculture while recognizing its benefits in expanding solar energy infrastructure. This approach will also help gain the support of legislators who may be resistant to expanding solar array sites in rural landscapes. Works Cited [1] Kochendoerfer, Nikola, and Michael Thorney.

[1] Essential Car Service: Renewing AmericaÕs Commitment to Rural Communities Through EV Charging By Jack Turner, jt797@cornell.edu The US spends billions of dollars on subsidies for gas cars, air service, and farmers. Though all are undoubtedly crucial services, the lack of direct subsidization of charging infrastructure has hampered the transition to renewable transportation, particularly in rural America. Background Rural America produces upwards of 36% of all domestic CO2 emissions.1 Many of these communities are based around agricultural practices where adaptation to climate-friendly practices is slow.2 An excessive urgency exists to make changes so that electric vehicles can be affordable to drive without seeking out chargers in distant locations. Rural drivers consume 25.6% of all light-duty gas (typically smaller cars) despite only constituting 18.8% of drivers in the US, and only 17% of rural Americans live within a mile of an electric vehicle charger.3 Even worse, rural drivers who drive the mostÑ roughly 3.6% of the US population Ñconsume around 1,950 gallons of gas annually, or nearly 13% of total gas consumption in the United States.4 This consumption, in turn, leads to a lack of vertical equity
