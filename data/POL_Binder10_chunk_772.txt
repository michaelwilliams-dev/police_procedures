Wiltshire Police recognises that identifying associations between members of Wiltshire Police and the public is a key measure in protecting the integrity of the Force, preventing corruption and the opportunity for corruption. Public confidence relies on the integrity of the Force and is linked directly to one of our organisational principles that we will build upon public approval and confidence in Wiltshire Police, as well as our stated Force values of Integrity and Impartiality.

It is therefore the responsibility of all staff to declare associations, with individuals or groups, that may impact upon public confidence, be perceived to compromise their integrity or adversely affect the ability of staff to carry out their duties in a manner that is lawful, fair and impartial.
