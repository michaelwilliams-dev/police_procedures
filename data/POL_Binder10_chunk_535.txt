on any incidents they attend through new feedback processes that are being developed in conjunction with Force Communications. This will allow us to gather a more realistic picture as to what staff encounter on a daily basis and help guide further training and equipment requirements. There is no nationally recognised awareness training available at present and this training will be an internal Wiltshire Police developed training initiative and probably one of the first forces to do so in the Country. Within this procedure it is recognised that some officers / staff may not wish to provide certain treatments as it is out of their remit and this should be accepted. However, staff who feel that by carrying out an intervention such as cutting off clothes or starting to reverse the burning process, that they are acting in the affected individuals best interest will be supported by Wiltshire Police and will be provided with feedback and an opportunity to discuss the incident with a member of the First Aid Working Group. Any staff member who does feel empowered and compelled to treat a burnt patient above and beyond basic life support should follow the suggested guidelines in Appendix A. Quarterly meetings will be held by the First Aid Working Group to ensure trends are reviewed both nationally and locally and also review any incidents where officers or staff have needed to use equipment supplied by Wiltshire Police. These meetings will be documented, written feedback will be provided to officers who submit incidents or near misses and will ultimately be fed back into Wiltshire Police Occupational Health and Safety Committee meetings chaired by the Chief Constable. 7. Training All police officers and police staff whose role is public facing will receive awareness training on: How to deal with an Acid Attack and the immediate first aid treatment. (see appendix A). Training will be delivered during their Initial First Aid Course by the Operational Training team within People Development. Refresher training on Acid Attacks will be reviewed by the First Aid Working Group annually. 8. Equipment Equipment will be initially decided and reviewed by the First Aid Working Group. Protective Equipment Every frontline facing member of staff should have readily available to them equipment to be able to protect themselves from injury and bodily fluids when attending an incident. This will include nitrile gloves for skin protection, eye protection for protection from any noxious chemicals and bodily fluids e.g. phlegm / blood, and face masks to minimise any inhalation injury. First Aid Equipment: Each first aid kit on vehicles will contain equipment to manage the initial phase of an acid attack this will include fluid to pour over skin to stop the burning process and shears to remove clothing. Equipment as and when used should be replaced as soon as practicable with replacement equipment being issued from Wiltshire Police Stores, Devizes. 9. Employee responsibilities Public facing employees must ensure they: Â• Protect themselves at all times with personal protective equipment available to them.
