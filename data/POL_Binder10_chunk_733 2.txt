recalled does not provide a power of entry into private premises. The recall power is intended to provide a means to respond to evidence of relapse or high-risk behaviour relating to mental disorder before the situation becomes critical and leads to the patient or other people being harmed. The need for recall might arise as a result of relapse, or by a change in the patientÕs circumstances giving rise to increased risk. The responsible clinician does not have to interview or examine the patient in person before deciding to recall them. Warrants under s42 MHA 1983 Section 42 MHA 1983 allows a patient who has been or is subject to a criminal justice process, who has been detained on a restricted hospital order (section 37 or section 41 MHA 1983), to be conditionally discharged to receive community care, sometimes with conditions and restrictions attached. During this period of conditional discharge, patients are liable to be recalled to hospital by the Secretary of State who may issue a warrant under section 42(3) MHA ordering the recall. Given that conditionally discharged patients were by definition thought to previously have posed a risk of serious harm to the public, police would usually be involved in the execution of the warrant. However, a warrant under this section is not a warrant of arrest for the purposes of Section 17 PACE, and therefore where entry needs to be forced in connection with this recall, a warrant under section 135(2) MHA is required unless grounds exist under PACE.
