A person guilty of an offence under regulation 2(1) is liable to a fine of up to £200. 2.28 Under Regulation 3(1), a person in possession of a deactivated firearm for a period of more than 14 days commits an offence if they fail to give notice of the deactivated firearm to the appropriate national authority unless the deactivated firearm has been transferred to that person and the transfer has already been notified by the person transferring it. In most instances this will avoid the need for the same deactivated firearm to be declared twice. Where a person in possession of a deactivated firearm commits an offence under regulation 3(1), it is a defence for that person to show that they reasonably believed that the transferor had given, or would give, notice of the transfer in accordance with the arrangements set out within regulation 2. A person guilty of an offence under this regulation is liable to a level 1 fine (£200). Readily convertible imitation firearms 2.29 Section 1
