the persons to which they refer. 5 As a title given to police reports, "missing person" is not to be confused with the international criminal type "enforced disappearance", known, in the common sense language, as "political disappearance". "Missing person", as discussed later in this article, is an administrative category attached in Brazilian police precincts to what has been called, in some occasions, "civil disappearance" (cf. Oliveira). "Enforced disappearance" is a crime against humanity, defined by the International Criminal Court in 1998 and regulated by the so-called Rome Statute. "Enforced disappearance" means "the arrest, detention or abduction of persons by a state or political organization, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of a state or political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of freedom or to give information about these persons' fate or whereabouts, with the intention of keeping them outside the reach of legal protection for a prolonged period." ( Jardim 2011:14). For an anthropological analysis of the current incidence of "enforced disappearances" in Brazil, which also explores the possibility that this crime remains concealed by the administrative category "missing person", see AraÂœjo (2008, 2012). 6 This formalization of investigations on paper is what guarantees that the prosecutor, judge and the target of the investigation are able to follow the legality of actions carried out in police headquarters (Vidal, 2013, p. 36). 7 The expression is used in article 9 of the Criminal Process Code (Brazil, 1941): "all pieces of police inquiry shall be, in a single process, reduced to writing or typed and, in this case, signed by the authority". 8 "Qualification" is the formal manner of identifying individuals in legal acts and documents, with at least some of the following information: full name, sex, date of birth, nationality, place of birth, marital status, parents' names, educational level, occupation, number of documents, phone number and address. 9 The formal procedure through which the interview is "translated" and registered in a "term of statement". 10 The research included 11 of the 14 "human trafficking for sexual exploitation" inquiries ongoing in the Rio de Janeiro Federal Police precinct chosen for the study. At the time, that precinct had the largest number of "human trafficking" cases of all Federal Police regional offices, which are situated in each Brazilian state. Only one inquiry (the one analyzed) led to an indictment. In addition to this inquiry, the veracity and authorship of the crime were established in only one other case that had been investigated by the Civil Police and whose criminals had already been prosecuted and convicted for state crimes, such as "sexual exploitation of children and adolescents" and "pimping". Since this investigation also gathered evidence of "international human trafficking", a copy of the inquiry was sent to the Federal Court and the Federal Police. 11 The "indictment" is the act of formalizing suspicion within the legal inquiry, usually at the end of investigations. For a more detailed explanation, see Vidal (2013). 12 Quoting Eilbaum (2012), "the VPI initials comes
