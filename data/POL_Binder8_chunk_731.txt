Sentence ? incarceration for three (3) to eight (8) years. ¤ 1 The same sentence applies to anyone who obtains the services of, entices or buys a trafficked person, as well as, being aware of this condition, transports, transfers or harbors them. ¤ 2 The sentence is increased by half if: I ? the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age; II ? if the victim, due to illness or mental disability, lacks the necessary judgment to engage in the act; III ? if the perpetrator is the victim's parent, step-parent, sibling, step-child, spouse, partner, tutor or curator, preceptor or employer or if he assumed, by law or other form, an obligation to care, protect or watch over the victim; or IV ? there is use of violence, grave threat or fraud. ¤ 3 If the crime is committed with the purpose of gaining economic advantage, a fine is also applied" (BRASIL, 1940). 2 See, for example, Comaroff and Comaroff (1991) and Hartman (1997). 3 "That is, not archives, but active file and other documents that are currently in use" (Hull, 2012b, p. 28). 4 The expression "graphic artifact" was coined by Hull (2012b) in order to designate the diverse documents and types of records produced in bureaucratic offices, such as maps, copies, cards, signatures and lists, indissociably drawing attention both to their material dimension and their role as crucial mediators in producing the persons to which they refer. 5 As a title given to police reports, "missing person" is not to be confused with the international criminal type "enforced disappearance", known, in the common sense language, as "political disappearance". "Missing person", as discussed later in this article, is an administrative category attached
