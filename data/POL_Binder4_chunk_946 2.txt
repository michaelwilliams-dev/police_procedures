Domestic abuse is often under-reported within minority communities. Stereotypes and assumptions can be made about the victimâs culture and in some cases, experiences of domestic abuse have been treated as housing or immigration cases by public authorities.124 Professionals working with minority communities should be aware of barriers and actively seek to ensure the right support is made available to overcome them, including appropriate interpretation and translation support where this may be needed. There are distinct structural barriers that minority communities face in accessing support. CSEW data for the year ending March 2020 suggests that those from a Mixed ethnic background were more likely to have experienced domestic abuse within the previous year (7.6%) than those from white (5.7%), black (3.7%), or Asian (3.6%) ethnic backgrounds.

This can lead to greater dependence on the partner or family if they have supported their being in the UK. They may also face greater economic impact of leaving a perpetrator if they are unable to claim benefits or access housing, or if they lose their immigration status by leaving their partner, including destitution and homelessness. This may be exploited by partners or family members to exert control over victims. Examples of how perpetrators can exert control over migrant victims include: Threatening to no longer provide support for their stay in the UK; Falsifying a victimâs immigration status and/or purposefully bringing a victim into the UK with an incorrect visa to ensure they remain
