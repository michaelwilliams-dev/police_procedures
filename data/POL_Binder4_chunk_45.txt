funds to establish shared appreciation mortgage programs. It is ideal for local governments to tackle this issue, as there tends to be extensive variation in housing policies by state and locality. Shared appreciation mortgages, or loans, are typically structured as deferred loans.5 They are interest-free, with repayment deferred until the property is either sold or refinanced, at which the loan is repaid.5 This differs from a typical mortgage, which is repaid in monthly payments. Furthermore, the homeowner pays a percentage of any property value appreciation gained over time.5 If a home depreciates, the buyer only repays the value of the loan, without interest.6 These programs allow for increased housing accessibility by lowering upfront costs for buyers, while also allowing lenders to recapture new property value gained over time. By financing mortgages with a combination of equity and debt, shared appreciation mortgages spread risk more evenly across lenders and borrowers, decreasing the risk of foreclosure if home prices fall.5 Policy Analysis A 2019 study from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University used data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to estimate the number of eligible households for shared appreciation mortgages across the country. The analysis found that 6.6 million potential homeowners could buy a home in their county with $25,000 to $100,000 in financial assistance, which the authors noted was typical of most shared appreciation programs.6The study also found that an additional 8.6 million people could buy a home with financial assistance of $100,000 or more.6 Furthermore, the study found that shared appreciation programs could ease racial disparities in homeownership.6 The study found that if all 1.4 million potential Black homeowners became homeowners through shared appreciation programs in 2013, their homeownership rate wouldâve increased by 10%.6 Moreover, if all potential Hispanic homeowners became homeowners through shared appreciation mortgages in 2013, their homeownership rate would have increased by 9.4%.6 A 2018 study in the Housing Policy Debate journal observed the short-term loan performance of homeowners participating in nine shared appreciation mortgage programs.7 Using a difference-in- difference analysis, the study compared the outcomes of shared appreciation mortgage holders with the outcomes of other first-time homebuyers in metropolitan areas.7 The results showed that shared appreciation mortgage purchasers had âsignificantly less mortgage debtâ and were âless likely to have a home equity line of credit.â7 Furthermore, the study observed no significant difference between shared appreciation and non-shared mortgage holders when analyzing 90- to 180-day delinquencies.7 This demonstrates that shared appreciation mortgage holders were maintaining homeownership at a similar rate to those with non- shared appreciation mortgages, highlighting the longevity of the programâs effectiveness. Highlights Homeownership rates have declined for young adults due to strict lending practices following the Great Recession and high home prices over the past decade.1 Shared appreciation mortgages are structured as deferred, interest-free loans repaid upon sale or refinancing, with homeowners sharing a percentage of any appreciation.5 Local and state housing authorities should utilize Community Development Block Grant funds to subsidize community financial institutions in providing
