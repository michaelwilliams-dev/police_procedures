MONITORING, INTERCEPTION AND AUDIT Wiltshire Police and OPCC reserves the right to monitor all communications (including telecommunications) using Force communications systems and where appropriate inspect the content of Email transmissions, text messages, Internet browsing sessions and smartphone application use. Such activity is considered necessary for the purposes of:  Protecting the network from malicious software, denial of service attacks and other external threats;  To investigate or detect use of computers contrary to legislation, policy or procedure;  Investigating and detecting improper use - preventing and detecting crime;  Monitoring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements - ensuring that Staff comply with rules governing the use of communications systems;  Quality control and training;  Monitoring load level activity to ensure adequate technical provision of the service;  In the interests of national security.
