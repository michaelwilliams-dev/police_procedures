Appropriate officers and appropriate pe r s on s should follow established local procedures on the retention and return of documents, material and information. Intelligence that arises during the appropriate officerÕs investigation may be passed to the NCA, police, HMRC and/or other departments and agencies (provided t h e a p p r o p r i a t e o f f i c e r i s s a t i s f i e d t h a t there is a legal basis in place either in statute or 1. common law for the passing of information between those bodies for that purpose).

There is no requirement for the same appropriate officer to make the variation or discharge application but if it is a different officer, that officer should be in a position to explain the genuine change of circumstances.
