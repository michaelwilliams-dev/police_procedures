passes the bill, it is important that it is implemented in a timely manner. Teachers should be required to attend professional development meetings with financial education experts who are well-versed in the curriculum to ensure the class is taught effectively. Once the policy is implemented, schools should monitor and evaluate the policyâs success. Student and teacher concerns should be addressed on a school-by-school basis through administrative avenues. Researchers will assess the policyâs efficacy by studying whether young New Yorkers are making better financial decisions after 10 years, measuring metrics including higher credit scores and lower loan delinquency rates. Despite the potential for strong support, several obstacles must be addressed. Budget constraints may raise concerns about the costs associated with curriculum development and teacher training. To address this, NYS should partner with local financial institutions that are interested in helping the community. These institutions have incentive to aid financial literacy among students, and could help mitigate costs with funding and curriculum planning support.17 However, even without these measures, no changes to the education budget would be necessary due to the policyâs low price, as there are minimal costs associated with curriculum design and a short training session.18 Additionally, concerns over another graduation requirement may be calmed by the widespread support for the course.19 In conclusion, despite possible implementation challenges, a financial literacy course in NYS high schools is feasible and would be extremely helpful for students. It is imperative to equip students with essential skills to confidently manage their financial futures, setting them on a path toward long- term stability and success.
