Actions Red Two or more perforations of the formed armour. Investigation to be commenced (Section 10.9). Amber One perforation of the formed armour. Immediate re-test (PQT) must be green. If not, follow red grading actions. Green No perforations of the formed armour. Continue with next PQT at specified interval.40 These results are concomitant with those for unformed panels. If unformed panels do not meet the requirements of PQT, formed panels cannot be accredited. 10.5.3. Plates PQT for plates shall comprise reduced levels of testing in accordance with Section 6.7. One plate shall be assessed per ammunition type for the certified protection level. PQT results shall conform to the requirements of certification testing (Table 8). If the results do not conform to these requirements, the batch being assessed shall be suspended and an investigation shall commence in accordance with Section 10.9. 10.5.4. Extended coverage panels Extended coverage panels, submitted for ballistic testing, shall be tested in accordance with the test methods and assessment criteria outlined in Section 6.10. If the results do not conform to these requirements, the batch being assessed shall be suspended and an investigation shall commence in accordance with Section 10.9. 10.6. Stab PQT 10.6.1. Unformed armour PQT for unformed stab resistant armour shall comprise reduced levels of testing in accordance with procedures outlined in Section 7.7. Table 22 outlines the quantities of strikes required for PQT assessment. Knife orientations for strikes have been given in brackets. 40 Based on the provision that associated unformed armour meets the requirements of Section 10.5.1.

Table 23: Assessment criteria for PQT stab tests on unformed armour Grading scheme Outcome of test Actions Red One or more penetrations of a knife greater than 9 mm. Investigation to be commenced (Section 10.9). More than one penetration of a spike. Amber Two or more penetrations of a knife between 8 mm and 9 mm or one penetration of spike. Immediate re-test (PQT) must be green. If not, investigation to be commenced (Section 10.9). Green Fully meets the requirements set out in Section 7.7. Continue with PQT at specified interval. 10.6.2. Formed armour Formed protective panels shall be marked in accordance with methods outlined in Section 7.8.2.2 following test methods outlined in Section 7.8. For knife only protection, one large panel shall be assessed in the standard formed armour strike pattern (Figure 16). For knife and spike protection, a large and a small panel shall be assessed, one each for knife and spike resistance testing. The size of panel used
