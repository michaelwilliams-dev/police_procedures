budgets.7 More importantly, automatic enrollment addresses behavioral inertia that can occur when saving is a voluntary choice. Many workers may procrastinate or feel overwhelmed by the process of setting up a retirement plan due to factors like complexity, lack of financial knowledge, and competing priorities. Automatic enrollment eliminates the initial burden of taking action and utilizes behavioral economics principles to help push individuals toward better financial strategy as AARP estimates American workers are 15 times more likely to save if they can save through automatic payroll reduction.8,9 Highlights Nearly half of private-sector employees lack access to quality retirement saving plans, leaving millions at heightened risk of financial insecurity in old age and increasing economic inequality.1 Federal automatic IRAs address retirement access barriers, especially for low- wage and gig workers lacking employer-sponsored plans.1 Automatic enrollment, overseen by the Treasury and IRS, ensures a seamless setup with payroll deductions, enabling easy contributions and portable accounts across jobs. Inspired by successful state models like CalSavers, federal IRAs aim to increase savings participation from 66% to 92% among eligible workers.6 Expanding access to retirement savings reduces reliance on government assistance, enhances financial stability, and narrows the wealth gap, benefiting individuals and the economy.7 Implementation Outreach efforts need to be led by state leaders and policymakers who have implemented similar initiatives in states like California, Oregon, Illinois, and others with a history of supporting similar financial programs to gain federal momentum. By engaging representatives from these states, the policy can gain credibility and utilize existing legislative frameworks for efficiency. Additionally, lobbying efforts should target representatives such as Congressman Richard Neal (D- MA), a prominent advocate for automatic IRAs and senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. Congressman Nealâs experience with bipartisan retirement plans and his influence within the committee would be invaluable in shaping and advancing the legislation for expedited passage through the House Committee on Ways and Means.10 With the new Senate dominated by Republicans coming in, framing the policy strategically is key. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat and Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is a critical ally due to his history of bipartisan retirement reforms, including the bipartisan Enhancing American Retirement Act with Republican Senator Mike Crapo.11 Wydenâs role can highlight automatic IRAs as a fiscally sound initiative that reduces reliance on government aid while encouraging personal savings. Advocacy should focus on committees like the Senate HELP Committee and the House Education and Workforce Committee. Presenting automatic IRAs as a market-driven, low- regulation solution that supports economic independence for working families can appeal to conservative values. Building coalitions with business groups, think tanks, and community voices strengthen external pressure on legislators. Given the significant changes this policy brings to the retirement structure, backlash from fiscal conservatives over high federal costs may arise. A study by AARP and the Retirement Research Center projected that 58% of workers with access to a similar model of universal auto-IRA would have saved more than $100,000 for retirement, compared to only 9% of those without access.
