that they reasonably believed that the transferor had given, or would give, notice of the transfer in accordance with the arrangements set out within regulation 2. A person guilty of an offence under this regulation is liable to a level 1 fine (£200). Readily convertible imitation firearms 2.29 Section 1 of the Firearms Act 1982 extended the provisions of section 1 of the 1968 Act to certain imitation firearms. Therefore, a firearm certificate is required to possess, purchase or acquire an imitation firearm which: 11 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law a) has the appearance of being a firearm to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies; and b) is so constructed or adapted as to be readily convertible into a firearm to which that section applies. 2.30 Under section 1(6) of the 1982 Act, an imitation firearm is regarded as readily convertible into a firearm to which section 1 of the 1968 Act applies if: a) it can be converted without any special skill on the part of the person converting it in the construction or adaptation of firearms of any description; and b) the work involved in converting it does not require equipment or tools other than such as are in common use by persons carrying out works of construction and maintenance in their own homes. Section 1(5) of the 1982 Act provides a defence for a person accused of an offence to show that he did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the imitation firearm` was so constructed or adapted as to be readily convertible into a firearm to which section 1 of the Act applies. Guidelines on the 1982 Act 2.31 Guidelines have been issued which advise on the technical measures that can be taken to prevent an imitation firearm from being readily convertible into a lethal barrelled weapon. These guidelines are intended primarily for the gun trade and are available from representative organisations, such as the Gun Trade Association. Offences involving imitation firearms 2.32 Section 16A of the 1968 Act makes it an offence to possess any firearm or imitation firearm with intent to cause, or to enable another person to cause, someone else to fear that unlawful violence will be used against them or another person. It provides for a maximum penalty of 10 yearsÕ imprisonment or a fine, or both. 2.33 Under section 20 of the 1968 Act it is an offence to trespass with an imitation firearm. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 6 months imprisonment (for trespass in a building) or 3 months (for trespass on land). The offence of trespassing with an imitation firearm in a building (in contrast to the offence committed with a firearm as defined by section 57(1) of the 1968 Act) is triable only summarily. Section 46(1)(b) of the 1968 Act (police powers of search with a warrant) applies to the seizure of imitation firearms as well as real firearms. See Part 1 of Schedule 6 to the 1968 for a
