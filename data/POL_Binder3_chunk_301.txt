states without voter leave mandates may disregard their employeesÕ voting aspirations and assign them exigent work on Election Day. These phenomena contribute to the disparities in voter turnout rates between socioeconomic strata. The 2016 presidential election illustrated socioeconomic disparities in voter turnout, with only 46% of individuals with family incomes below twice the federal poverty line voting, in contrast to 68% of those whose incomes exceeded that threshold.2 Guaranteeing paid time off for workers would ensure that those living paycheck to paycheck have equal voting opportunities, helping bridge the divide in voter turnout between lower and higher-income individuals. Policy Idea The federal government should create a federal holiday on Election Day. To offset any productivity loss from an additional federal holiday, Veterans Day could be moved from November 11th to coincide with national elections on the second Tuesday of November.3 Finally, Congress should move to mandate a paid 3- hour leave period for workers on Election Day. In 2012, approximately 3.5 million voters endured queues exceeding an hour to cast their ballots, with minority voters being seven times more likely than white voters to encounter such delays.4 The 3-hour period would grant voters latitude in the event of distant polling sites or protracted wait times. Policy Analysis The absence of federally mandated paid time off on Election Day places the onus of determining paid voter leave policies on individual states and, ultimately, on employersÑresulting in significant disparities in voter turnout between socioeconomic groups. In 2021, 45% of large companies and 55% of small companies afforded their employees paid time off to vote.4 Accordingly, potential votersÑ particularly those who depend on hourly payÑare often at the mercy of their employers on Election Day. By requiring paid leave nationally, the federal government would seize this discretion from corporations, allowing more of its constituents to access the ballot box. Paid voter leave is hardly a pioneering initiative, as numerous democratic regimes worldwide, including Mexico, Belgium, and Argentina, have implemented a similar policy with corollary increased turnout.5 Additionally, 14 states have already made Election Day a public holiday.6 However, a Princeton University study found that making Election Day a holiday does not significantly increase voter turnout, emphasizing the need to implement policies like paid leave in tandem with the holiday to effectively enhance participation.7 According to Census Bureau data, approximately 27% of nonvoters in the 2022 midterm elections did not vote due to scheduling incompatibility.8 While making Election Day a federal holiday and granting paid leave to frontline workers would not eradicate all scheduling problems, it would substantially reduce this barrier for many individuals, especially those in lower-income or hourly positions. Moreover, this policy would help level the playing field across socioeconomic groups, allowing more Americans to participate in the democratic process. Critics of efforts to make Election Day a national holiday often cite the costs, with some estimating a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion.9 However, this proposal remedies this issue by moving Veterans Day to Election Day, ensuring more federal holidays do
