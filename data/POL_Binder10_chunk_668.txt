Sections within these procedures apply to both Police Officers and Police Staff unless otherwise indicated.

To be entitled to take time off for antenatal care, you are required to produce a certificate from your doctor, registered midwife or registered health visitor, confirming your pregnancy. Except in the case of the first appointment, you should also produce evidence of the appointment, such as a medical certificate or appointment card, if requested to do so. Antenatal care may include relaxation and parent craft classes that your doctor, midwife or health visitor has advised you to attend, in addition to medical examinations. You should endeavour to give your line manager as much notice as possible of antenatal appointments and, wherever possible, try to arrange them as near to the start or end of the working day. An individual who has a qualifying relationship with you, (the co-parent of the expected child), is eligible to take unpaid time off to accompany you up to two antenatal appointments. You must ensure that your Line Manager is advised in advance of an appointment. You may be required to provide evidence of further appointments. Ante-natal time is treated as duty.
