victim resides or works. 5. In the unlikely event that it is impossible to determine a Force Area using these principles the NFIB will determine a Force Area. Offences not recorded by Action Fraud (Do NOT report the following fraud offences to Action Fraud):  making, supplying or use of articles to commit fraud*  possessing/controlling article(s) for use in fraud*  possession of false documents*  making off without payment/bilking* (forecourt crime)   forgery or use of drug prescription*  fraud or forgery relating to vehicle or driver records*  other forgery* (* these are not recorded by Action Fraud) All the above offences are recorded within Force where the offence has been committed under the respective Home Office Counting Rule codes. Call for Service (CFS): In general terms a Ôcall for serviceÕ is a report that requires a response from the police. In the case of fraud the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR) define the circumstances that should be treated as a call for service. Reports received from members of the public that they have been a victim of Fraud. The call handler will THRIVE+ the incident and those which meet the call for service criteria will be allocated to the most appropriate department (see Fraud Allocation Matrix). The call for service criteria is defined as follows: > The victim is considered vulnerable or they are at risk > There is a known local offender (i.e. resides in Wiltshire and identity can be determined relatively simply) > The crime is ongoing or has recently occurred (i.e. are there time bound investigative leads Ð e.g. CCTV, ANPR enquiries etc.). If any of the CFS criteria applies the crime must be investigated as appropriate. If the Call for service criteria is not met the call handler will not create a contact record, but refer the caller to Action Fraud, unless they are Vulnerable or at Risk.
