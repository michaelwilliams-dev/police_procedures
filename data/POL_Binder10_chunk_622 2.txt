The SIO must therefore be confident of:  A lawful power to seize;  A continuing lawful purpose to retain and examine;  A clear policy for disposal;  The fact that the coroner has been informed in writing of all material preserved; and updated where the status of the investigation reverts to non-criminal. Forces are advised to adopt a policy whereby human tissue exhibits are reviewed periodically by force review teams, as reliance cannot be placed on those originally investigating homicide cases, due to the passage of time and the retirement and turnover of staff. This will help to prevent human tissue exhibits being overlooked and retained unnecessarily when they are no longer required for a criminal justice purpose.
