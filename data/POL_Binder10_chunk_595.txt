To achieve this aim, this Honour Based Abuse Policy will support colleagues and partner agencies in understanding the strategic intent of Wiltshire Police. This mirrors the National Policing Strategy for Honour Based Abuse (HBA), Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and Forced Marriage (FM). Investigating Officers should refer to the HBA/FGM/FM procedure for tactical advice on the Ôone chance ruleÕ and considerations for what should and should not be done when investigating offences.

This includes Honour Based Violence but recognises that some Abuse will not be violent (in compliance with the Home Office definition for Domestic Abuse). Please refer to Appendix A for definitions of Honour Based Abuse, Female Genital
