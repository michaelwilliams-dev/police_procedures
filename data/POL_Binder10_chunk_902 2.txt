The Victim The investigating officer should consider all potential lines of enquiry including:- o Afraid of what the suspect might do to themselves or someone else and the degree of fear shared by the victim√ïs friends, family and colleagues o Any other person who has threatened the victim or who they are afraid of o Physical or mental health affected by the stalking or harassment (e.g. whether they are feeling depressed or suicidal) o Vulnerability of the victim to stalking or harassment, such as mental ill health, disability, learning difficulties, or residence in an isolated location.

It should be borne in mind if a person has previously resided outside Wiltshire that there may be a history of similar offending recorded elsewhere and it is compulsory on all agencies to carry out checks where this is believed to be an issue. Any individual that causes concern for these reasons should be considered jointly in a multi-agency meeting with regards to some form of offender management being put in place and a joint decision made as to who should be informed in order that victims can be safeguarded.
