Wiltshire Police Social Media Accounts: Effective communication can have a significant impact on the achievement of operational or corporate objectives, in particular community engagement. It has a direct impact on our reputation as a Force and our relationships with staff, stakeholders, customers and the public. Before using a Wiltshire Police social media account for communication purposes, the employee should ensure that it is the most appropriate channel for the message/dialogue. If in doubt, please contact the Corporate Communications and Engagement Department (CCE). Using social media is a very positive tool, however, it can potentially create a number of risks to both the users and the wider reputation of the organisation.
