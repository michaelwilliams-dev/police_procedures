be aware that indebtedness and unmanageable borrowing can pose a risk to the integrity of individual members of Wiltshire Police. In some instances individuals may become vulnerable to corruption. Any undue pressure, improper influence or manipulation of Wiltshire Police employees by criminal individuals and organisations could cause significant damage to public trust in the Police service. 3. DEFINITION OF UNMANAGEABLE DEBT / BORROWING Personal debt can be considered unmanageable when the level of required payments cannot be met through normal income streams. This would typically occur over a sustained period of time, causing overall debt / borrowing levels to increase to a level where repayments become impossible to manage.

Managers are expected to discuss the risks posed by indebtedness and unmanageable borrowing with their staff by way of an Integrity Health Check conducted at least annually during one-to-one meetings or as part of the ePDR process.
