children under 18 only and 68% disagreed that it should apply to present day abuse and neglect only. 65% disagreed that it should apply to abuse and neglect encountered during the course of a practitionerÕs day to day role only. 99. Views were more balanced in respect of the remaining statements. 54% agreed that any new duty should apply to both suspected and known child abuse and neglect; 57% agreed that a new duty should apply to abuse or neglect within the home and within organisations or institutions (e.g. boarding schools); and 58% agreed that it should be triggered if a practitioner had Ôreasonable cause to suspectÕ a child was being abused or neglected, or was likely to be abused or neglected. 100. The consultation then invited respondents to provide any further information on the proposed scope of the duties. 22 Question 13: Are there aspects of the proposed scope that you disagree with, or you would like to provide further information to support your answer to question 12?

Base: 192 total respondents. Percentages are calculated by dividing the response count for each code by the number of respondents (192) and will not add up to 100%. 101. Responses to this question were split on whether the suggested scope of a new duty was too wide or not wide enough. 8% commented that it should not cover suspicion of abuse or neglect, feeling that evidence would be needed. Of those respondents who felt that the suggested scope was not wide enough, 15% thought that a new duty should cover a wider age range than just children aged under 18 and 8% felt it should cover historic abuse. 102. The main themes from the written submissions we received were that the scope of any new duty should not extend to adults but that any new duty should cover all professions. 103.
