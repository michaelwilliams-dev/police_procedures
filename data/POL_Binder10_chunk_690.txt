Where the individual is the second parent of the child in respect of whom the leave is to be taken and he/she requests ordinary parental leave to begin when your child is born, your notice must specify the expected week of childbirth and the duration of the period of leave. The individual must give this notice at least 21 days before the expected week of childbirth. d. Where the ordinary parental leave is in respect of an adopted child and is to begin on the date of the placement, the individual's notice must be given to the organisation at least 21 days before the beginning of the week in which the child is to be placed for adoption, or as soon as is reasonably practicable thereafter.
