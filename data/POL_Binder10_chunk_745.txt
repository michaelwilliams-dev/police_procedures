Template v7 WILTSHIRE POLICE FORCE POLICY National Investigators Exam Ð Failures and Deferrals Date of Publication: June 2020 Version: 2.0 Next Review Date: June 2022 POLICY STATEMENT This policy seeks to clarify the process around unsuccessful entrants of the National Investigators Exam (NIE), and explain Wiltshire PoliceÕs stance in relation to deferrals of the exam. This policy is aimed at both police officers and police staff members enrolled on to the Initial Crime Investigators Development Programme (ICIDP).
