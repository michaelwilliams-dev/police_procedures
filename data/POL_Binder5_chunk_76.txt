(R v Howells 1997). Possession may be constructive (that is, having free access to the firearms rather than physically possessing them) (Sullivan v Earl of Caithness 1976). 5.3 In some (very restricted) circumstances certain categories of people may be authorised by the Act to Òhave in their possessionÓ firearms and/or ammunition without a certificate, but not to purchase or acquire. Such people might include licensed slaughterers, a person taking part in theatrical, television or film productions, warehouse operatives or carriers (see Chapter 6) and those authorised under section 7 of the Firearms Act 1968. See also Chapter 6 and Chapter 24, about firearms that may have been found amongst the property of somebody who has died. Chapter 6 also includes details of other exemptions from the need to have a certificate, including the use of borrowed rifles on private premises, as does Chapter 17 on clubs. See also chapters 14 and 26. 5.4 The word ÒsellÓ is often used throughout the Act in conjunction with the word ÒtransferÓ. Transfer is defined in section 57(4) of the 1968 Act as including letting on hire, giving, lending and parting with possession. General prohibitions 5.5 Persons prohibited under section 21 of the 1968 Act may not possess any firearms or ammunition, not just those for which a certificate is required. Thus the prohibition extends to all air weapons, air gun pellets and shot gun ammunition. It should also be noted that: (a) The prohibition applies to persons sentenced in all parts of the United Kingdom, including those sentenced in Northern Ireland. Section 29 of the 32 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law Criminal Justice Act 1972 amended section 21 of the 1968 Act. In its unamended form, section 21 applied the prohibition only to those sentenced in England, Wales and Scotland; the amendment in section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 made the similar prohibition on possessing firearms and ammunition in Northern Ireland (previously section 19 of the Firearms Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, now Article 63 of the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004) effective in England, Wales and Scotland. (b) The prohibition includes detention in a young offenders institution, or in youth custody. Paragraph 24 of Schedule 14 to the Criminal Justice Act 1982 added the words Òor to youth custody for such a termÓ to subsections (1) (after Òthree years or moreÓ) and (2) (after Òless than three yearsÓ) of section 21 of the 1968 Act. Paragraph 6 of Schedule 8 to the Criminal Justice Act 1988 amended section 21(1) and (2) of the 1968 Act by inserting Òor detention in a young offenders institutionÓ after Òyouth custodyÓ. 5.6 Convictions overseas and periods of detention under the Mental Health Act or the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Scotland Act 2003 do not count towards prohibition, although they might be relevant to fitness and public safety. 5.7 A court in England and Wales that imposes a suspended sentence may order the forfeiture of a firearm or cancel a firearm or shot gun certificate.
