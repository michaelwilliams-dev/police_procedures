Pre- committee support can be garnered by engaging bipartisan caucuses like the Problem Solvers caucus and hosting stakeholder roundtables with legislators, industry leaders, and public interest groups. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, could introduce the bill due to her prior leadership on tech issues, in alignment with existing federal efforts around AI regulation, such as Bidenâs executive order. 9 Given that this issue directly affects the elections for sitting lawmakers, who are at risk of being deepfaked themselves, conversations have already been widespread.18 These existing discussions help set the foundation for strong legislative support. Once introduced, hearings would feature AI ethics experts, media representatives, and technology researchers who can testify on the urgency of managing AI-driven misinformation. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation would then refine the bill, paving a smoother path through a potentially polarized legislature. Measuring success would involve several metrics, such as reducing flagged AI-generated content, improving public trust in media, and the efficacy of the compliance rates amongst platforms. Monthly compliance reports would be submitted to the FCC, with third-party audits ensuring detection tools are working effectively.16 Platforms failing to comply would face fines, with the revenue generated from these fines back into social media literacy programs that train consumers to engage with information more carefully. The FCC would gather public feedback throughout the rollout, with a community advisory board established to collect input from users, advocacy organizations, and technology companies. This feedback would allow the FCC to adjust implementation guidelines as needed, ensuring the policy remains relevant and effective as the technology evolves.
