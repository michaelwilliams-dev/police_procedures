First published 23 October 2013 Updated 3 April 2024 Civil contingencies 3 mins read An emergency or major incident is likely to place a significant burden on the police. Business continuity planning helps police forces understand the relative priority of functions if their ability to maintain day-to-day operations has been compromised. A continued policing provision is still required, both in the area directly affected and across the rest of the force area. This requirement is one of the strategic objectives in maintaining the rule of law. The effectiveness of any response to an incident can be reduced where there is a partial or full breakdown in law and order in the location and wider affected area. Business continuity management is the strategic and tactical capability of the organisation to plan for and respond to incidents and business disruptions, so business operations can continue at an acceptable pre-defined level. The starting point for business continuity plans is that normal business cannot be achieved in extraordinary circumstances. It is, therefore, important that resources can be deployed and reallocated to critical functions. Planning must consider the likelihood and effects of losing one or more critical activities or infrastructure. Business continuity plans list the minimum resources and staffing levels required to fulfil only those functions. Plans should consider the IT, equipment, building and human resources required to deliver identified critical functions for each department. The risk and resilience of each force is different and must be evaluated locally. Category 1 responders produce local business continuity plans. Local resilience forums (LRFs) need to be aware of these plans and support business continuity management activities. The National Police Chiefs' Council has produced new business continuity management guidance.
