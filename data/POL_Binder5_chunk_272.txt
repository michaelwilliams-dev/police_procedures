security considerations for expanding pistol ammunition held by virtue of F(A)A1997 should be the same as in paragraphs 2.46 to 2.48 above. 2.54 Ammunition held as part of a collection should be subject to normal security provisions as in paragraphs 2.46 to 2.47 above. 2.55 Shot Pistols possessed for vermin control by virtue of section 4(1) & (2) of F (A) A1997 should normally be considered in similar terms to that found in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 below. 2.56 SelfÐContained Gas Cartridge guns to which section 5(1)(AF) applies should normally be subject to Level 1 security. The precise arrangements are for the police to determine based on the level of risk involved in each case, taking account of factors such as local crime rates and location of the property. 2.57 Where a single firearm is possessed as a trophy of war by virtue of section 6 of F (A) A1997, with no ammunition suitable for use with that firearm being kept, a minimum of Level 2 security should be considered, commensurate with the risk involved when small firearms are held. Safe-keeping of keys 2.58 Only authorised persons should have access to any of the keys for any cabinet etc. containing firearms and section 1 ammunition. Care needs to be taken in selecting locations for the storage of keys, particularly any spare sets, to avoid them being discovered and improperly used. Consideration could be given to using a key cabinet or secure storage (safe) to store keys and spare keys. In all cases primary and spare should be stored separately. 2.1 PART 3: FIREARMS HELD FOR PROFESSIONAL OR SPECIFIC BUSINESS PURPOSES 3.1 It is important to stress that every case should be dealt with on its individual merits Ð see Part 1 of this Handbook. Slaughtering Instruments 3.2 Small firearms which are constructed or adapted as slaughtering instruments capable of firing up to two shots without re-loading, may be kept at dwellings under the same conditions as those applying to general section 1 & 2 firearms. 3.3 Where such slaughtering instruments are kept at business premises, the firearms should be in a cabinet to BS7558 (1992) within a part of the premises that is secured to at least Level 2 of that in the dwelling specification. If the premises are unoccupied, a signalling alarm to BS4737 - 3.30:2015 should be considered. Firearms for Humane Killing or Treatment of Animals 3.4 Small firearms, as defined by section 5(1)(aba) of FA1968, kept solely for the humane killing of animals under section 3 of F(A)A1997, and adapted to fire no more than two shots without reloading, should be subject to Level 2 or 3, commensurate with the risk involved. Veterinary Use 3.5 Firearms designed to discharge missiles containing drugs for the treatment of animals should normally be stored with the drug/missile separate from the firearm. 3.6 When stored in dwellings, or in surgeries attached to or containing the dwelling of the veterinary surgeon or resident staff of the practice, the conditions applicable to their
