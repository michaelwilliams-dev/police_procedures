preparation 7.6.1. Conditioning panels All armour shall be placed in an environment held at a temperature of 20 ± 3¡C and 40 to 70% relative humidity for a minimum of 12 hours prior to testing. Protective panels shall be laid flat at all times when conditioning and stacked in piles of no more than four panels. 7.6.2. Marking panels 7.6.2.1. Unformed armour Strikes shall be performed on unformed protective panels in accordance with the strike rules defined in Section 7.1.4 on panel sizes shown in Table 15. For unformed armour, strikes on each specified size shall be performed on a single panel, unless this is in contravention of strike placement rules in which case an additional panel may be used. Table 15: Unformed armour stab test quantities Panel size No. of panels Energy level No. of strikes Knife Spike Knife Spike Small 1 1* E1 5 5 E2 2 (45¡, 90¡) n/a Medium 1 E1 10 n/a E2 2 (45¡, 60¡, 90¡) n/a Large 1 1* E1 15 10 E2 5 n/a * If necessary, where applicable spike tests may be conducted on the same panels used in knife testing adhering with strike placement rules defined in Table 12. Each knife strike shall be conducted in a different orientation. Unless otherwise specified in Table 15, these orientations shall be at 0¡, 30¡, 45¡, 60¡ and 90¡ aligned to the long axis of the protective panel (Figure 26). The protective panel shall be rotated to achieve these orientations. Figure 26: Image showing intended orientation of knife strikes on a protective panel Prior to conducting any stab testing, all stab locations shall be marked onto the panel. A central stab region shall be drawn by first identifying the centremost point on the panel, defined by the intersection of the centrelines of panel (from the widest point) in vertical and horizontal directions. A box extending 25% of the overall height of the panel in each direction shall be drawn from this centre point (Figure 27). Proportionally, 80% of strikes shall be conducted in the centre of the protective panel. The remaining strikes shall be conducted outside of this area in accordance with strike placement rules (Table 12). Overall Height Overall Width Figure 27: Knife strike placement on unformed protective panels On medium and large unformed armour panels, at least one E1 energy level strike shall be performed at a location 55 ± 5 mm from the edge of the panel, defined by the test facility. 7.6.2.2. Formed armour For formed armour testing, separate panels are required for knife and spike testing on each size due to the prescribed locations of the strikes being performed. Table 16 shows the quantities of knife and spike strikes required on each size of armour for each protection type (i.e. two small and two large formed armour panels would be required for knife and spike protection).
