For the purposes of subsection (2)(c) or (d), it does not matter whether the aerodrome is a relevant aerodrome when the dispute arises. 29B Powers of Secretary of State in relation to disputes This section applies whereâ a dispute about the policing of a relevant aerodrome is referred to the Secretary of State under section 29A, or although no such reference is made, the Secretary of State thinks that there is a dispute about the policing of a relevant aerodrome. The Secretary of State may require any relevant person to take such steps as the Secretary of State thinks may assist to resolve the dispute. The Secretary of State may require any relevant person to make payments in respect of any costs incurred by another person (whether or not a relevant person) in connection with the taking of the steps mentioned in subsection (2).
