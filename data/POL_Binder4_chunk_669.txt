Where an appeals tribunal allows an appeal it may, if it considers that it is appropriate to do so, make an order dealing with the appellant in a way whichâ appears to the tribunal to be less severe than the way in which he was dealt with by the decision appealed against; and is a way in which he could have been dealt with by the person who made the decision.
