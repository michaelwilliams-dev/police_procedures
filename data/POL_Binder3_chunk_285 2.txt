local and state levels would provide useful data on the policyÕs effectiveness for federal policymakers who may be on the fence. Policy research centers and state government agencies could compare gun death rates in the state before and after implementation, which researchers could use to determine the effectiveness of these policies. As the US faces comparably high gun death statistics, it is more important than ever to implement creative solutions to combat gun deaths. Placing a share of the responsibility on the private sector would be an effective way to promote safe gun ownership and use. Works Cited [1] Gramlich, John.
