if the hinges have been destroyed/removed. The hinge bolts of not less than 40mm by 20mm cross section must be continuously welded to the inner surface on the hanging side of the door. The hinge bolts should fit snugly against the door surround, passing at least 20mm behind the surround. a) c) hinge bolts should be fitted to support each hinge provided on the door and in the case of only two being required, they must be positioned either at or above the level of the upper hinge, and at or below the lower hinge on the door; d) when a 6mm door pattern is chosen, steel lock pockets must be fitted so that the edge of the angle is not cut through, but slotted to receive the lock. e) for inward opening doors, lock bolt receivers fabricated to the standards above must be continuously welded to the surround. They should be constructed to permit only necessary play in the door. Their vertical opening should allow for any flexing/expanding the door may need. 34. Solid timber and steel lined doors must be hung in a heavy duty timber frame fitted to the surrounding walls by appropriate fixing devices of not less than 150mm length at no more than 400mm centres with such devices not more than 150mm from the corners. 35. Steel door frames for up to 6mm thick steel doors fitted in walls not less than 125mm thick can be fabricated by 100mm x 100mm x 6mm angle, ideally fitted with the fixings inside the room. If this is not possible, the heads must be welded or splayed to prevent removal. 36. Steel door surrounds to be fitted in solid or cavity walls not less than 230mm thick, may be fabricated, dependent upon 6mm or 10mm construction of either: a) 100mm by 75mm by 6mm/10mm steel angle with a 100mm by 6mm/10mm plate continuously welded to the "L" to produce a "T" section frame 200mm by 75mm by 6mm/10mm; b) 200mm by 75mm by 6mm/10mm steel "T" section; c) the surround must be secured by rag bolts or similar high strength masonry devices both on the external and internal faces of the "T" section surround. The outer side ones welded or splayed to prevent removal. The fixings should not be greater than 400mm apart, and not more than 150mm from the corners. d) if the door is outward opening, hinge bolts must be fitted sufficient to prevent door failure in the event of an attack on the exposed hinge pins. 37. Gun room doors should normally be secured by: a) two mortice locks to at least BS3621-2017 or its equivalent; or b) two locks from the HELA Tech doc 26/5. 38. It is acceptable for a door to be secured by a system of driven bolt work which is to the following standard: a) the bolt work can be either lever or key driven. b) the bolts should operate: i) along the opening edge, driving a minimum of 3
