that a child was suffering, or was at risk of suffering, abuse or neglect. This option was developed following consideration of an extension of the existing wilful neglect offences, which currently apply in relation to healthcare and adult social care, to child abuse and neglect. 83. Respondents were asked for their views on a series of statements about the benefits and risks of introducing a duty to act. Question 8: To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements? 1. A duty to act could strengthen accountability on individuals and organisations in protecting children from abuse and neglect 2. A duty to act could have an adverse impact on the child protection system (eg impacting recruitment and retention of staff, and negatively impacting the serious case review process) 3. A duty to act on child abuse and neglect would likely lead to better outcomes for children than a duty focused solely on the reporting of child abuse and neglect 4. A duty to act allows professionals discretion to decide what action should be taken to best protect children in each case 5. The focus of sanctions for the duty to act on wilful, deliberate or reckless failures would ensure that those responsible for the very worst failures in care would be held accountable 0% 50% 100% Strongly Agree Agree Neither agree nor disagree Disagree Strongly Disagree Don't know Response Q 8.1 Q 8.2 Q 8.3 Q 8.4 Q 8.5 Strongly Agree 160 24% 141 21% 137 20% 97 14% 114 17% Agree 293 43% 205 30% 257 38% 273 40% 259 39% Neither agree nor disagree 94 14% 132 19% 146 22% 135 20% 124 18% Disagree 88 13% 147 22% 83 12% 107 16% 97 14% Strongly Disagree 42 6% 35 5% 41 6% 57 8% 61 9% Don√ït know 3 <1% 23 3% 14 2% 12 2% 17 3% Total responses: 680 100% 683 100% 678 100% 681 100% 672 100% 84. 58% of respondents who answered this question agreed with the statement that a duty to act would likely lead to better outcomes for children than a duty focussed solely on the reporting of child abuse and neglect. A majority of respondents (54%) also agreed that a duty to act would allow professionals discretion to decide what action should be taken to best protect children in each case. Most of the respondents (56%) agreed that the focus of sanctions for breach of the duty to act on wilful, deliberate or reckless failures would ensure that those responsible for the very worst failures would be held accountable.
