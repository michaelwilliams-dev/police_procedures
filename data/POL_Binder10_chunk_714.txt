birth event or placement. e.g.: There is no right to 3 lots of leave for triplets. Leave must be taken during the period of 56 days (8 weeks) beginning with the date on which the child is born, or the first day of the expected week of childbirth, whichever is the later. In the case of adoption, you can take leave from the date of the childÕs placement or from a fixed date which can be up to 14 days before the expected week of placement. 8.6 Support Leave Pay You are entitled to receive full pay for the first week. Individuals who have 26 weeks continuous service at the 14th week before the baby is due (or before notification of a placement of a child for adoption) will be entitled to be paid for the second week at Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) rate (which is equivalent to SMP) 8.7 Additional Rights If you are a new parent and your partner is returning or has returned to work, you could have the right to Shared Parental Leave.
