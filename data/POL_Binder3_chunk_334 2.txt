push students out of the classroom.8 For instance, a study from the University of California, Irvine found that high school students who experience suspension or expulsion are more than twice as likely to face criminal charges as young adults.9 Policy Idea In order to address the issues of school policing, police officers should be removed from K-12 public schools in New York City. Instead, funds should be reallocated to alternative safety measures, which may include mental health professionals, counselors, and restorative justice programs. Counselors and mental health professionals will be responsible for addressing student issues. By focusing on root causes and addressing issues through dialogues, retributive approaches will not be necessary, even in violent interactions between students. The proposed approach prioritizes mental well-being and non-punitive approaches to student misconduct. There are many implemented models and blueprints for effective restorative justice models in schools. The NYCDOE will evaluate the funding needed using the money that they currently spend on police presence. Overall, this policy will reduce suspensions and expulsions, improve academic outcomes, and create a safer and more supportive learning environment for all students. Policy Analysis Transformative approaches to school safety have yielded positive results around the country. For example, in Chicago, removing School Resource Officers (SROs) led to a decrease in high-level discipline infractions.10 Schools retaining SROs had a larger proportion of Black students and experienced higher suspension rates. Eliminating these officers would mitigate racial biases and keep more students in school. Furthermore, in Des Moines, Black students were six times more likely to have contact with police than their white counterparts.11 When the Des Moines school board redirected funds from policing to restorative practices, student arrests decreased, and the sense of safety among students increased.12 These initiatives have yielded promising results, including reduced court referrals, reduced suspensions, and an increase in staff appropriately responding to behavioral crises.13 These results highlight that this policy is both effective and equitable. This policy is also cost-effective. The financial burden of employing police in schools diverts funds from other necessities that would address school safety without perpetuating inequities. In 2018, 26 states invested over $960 million in enhancing SRO presence and school security, while 60% of public schools did not offer mental health services, and 18% had no paid school nurses.14 In schools where Black students were the majority, 20.7% had more security staff than mental health professionals, compared to just 2.5% in majority White schools.15 If police were removed, schools would be able to afford mental health staff. Funding for restorative justice programs would be cheaper,16 as training existing educators and staff would not require paying additional full time salaries. Furthermore, redirecting funds into rehabilitative training and mental health resources will have a positive effect, rather than continuing to spend millions of dollars on a system that fails to keep students safe. Restorative policies have been proven to improve the average GPA and reduce student gang membership, depression, and substance abuse.17 Highlights Â• While the federal government has invested over $1 billion
