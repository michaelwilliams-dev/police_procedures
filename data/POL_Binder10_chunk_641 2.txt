It is emphasized that this list is not exhaustive in any way and in some cases, other threats may also exploit these vulnerabilities. Environment & Infrastructure 1 Lack of physical protection of the building, doors and windows Ð could be exploited by for example threat of theft 2 Inadequate or careless use of physical access control to buildings, areas and rooms Ð could be exploited by, for example, the threat of wilful damage 3 Unstable power grid Ð could be exploited by, for example, the threat of power fluctuation 4 Location in an area susceptible to flood Ð could be exploited by, for example, the threat of flooding Hardware 5 Lack of periodic replacement schemes Ð could be exploited by, for example, the threat of deterioration of storage media 6 Susceptibility to voltage variations - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of power fluctuation 7 Susceptibility to temperature variations - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of temperature extremes 8 Susceptibility to humidity, dust, soiling - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of dust 9 Sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of tempest radiation 10 Insufficient maintenance / faulty installation of storage media - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of staff error 11 Lack of efficient and effective configuration control - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of staff error Software 12 Unclear or incomplete development specifications - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of software failure 13 No or insufficient software testing - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of unauthorized use of software or use of software by unauthorized users 14 Complicated user interface - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of staff error 15 Lack of identification and authentication mechanisms - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of masquerading user identities 16 Lack of audit and accounting - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of use of software in an unauthorized way of repudiation of action 17 Well known flaws in software - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of the use of software by unauthorized users 18 Unprotected password tables - could be exploited by, for example, the threat of masquerading user identities 19 Poor password management (easily guessable passwords, storing passwords in clear view, insufficient frequency of password change) - could
