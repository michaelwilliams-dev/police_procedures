Application for a FGM Protection Order Notes for guidance Please read these notes with the leaflet FGM700 - FGM Protection Orders Section 1 Ð Applicants There are three types of applicant. The person to be protected, someone on their behalf and a relevant third party. If you are the person to be protected and are applying yourself for an order, with or without legal representation, you are also the applicant. Fill in section 1 only, and then go to section 4.
