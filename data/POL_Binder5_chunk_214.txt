Prohibited weapons authority 19.18 Part 2 of The Firearms (Fees) Regulations 2019 sets out the fees payable to the Home Office or Scottish Government before a relevant section 5 authority, permitting the possession of prohibited weapons, is granted, varied or renewed. A Ôrelevant section 5 authorityÕ includes an authority granted to: registered firearms dealers (RFDs), carriers, exhibitors, maritime security companies, trophy of war or competitive shooters. Further information about application types and the relevant applicable fee is contained in Part 2 of the 2019 Regulations. 19.19 Dealers who make an application to the police to be an RFD as part of their section 5 application will be subject to a discount equal to the amount of their fee to the police to be registered as an RFD (currently £200). This will avoid double payment. As the dates for RFD and section 5 renewal are synchronised after grant, the discount will ordinarily apply to renewal applications. In cases where the applicant is already an RFD and applying for grant of a section 5 authority, they will not benefit from the discount.
