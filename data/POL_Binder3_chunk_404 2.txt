[1] HEALTHCARE POLICY Director: Kaitlyn Z Varriale Assistant Director: Zo OÕHalloran Analysts: Arjun Anugole, Tanirika Choudhry, and Kimia Shahriyar Care for Colorectal Cancer: Establishing Self- Service FIT Kiosks to Diminish Racial Inequities By Arjun Anugole, aa2823@cornell.edu The rates of colorectal cancer are considerably disproportionate for minority populations compared to their white counterparts. To address this disparity, the federal government should implement a policy establishing self-service testing kiosks as an effective alternative to traditional screenings. Background In 2020, the World Health Organization reported that there were approximately 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) and over 930,000 resulting deaths, making it the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortalities in the world.1 However, for minority populations in the US, this number is significantly greater. African Americans have a 20% higher incidence and a 40% higher mortality rate for CRC compared to other racial groups.2 This inequality can be attributed to structural barriers, including mistrust, maltreatment, and the lack of access to health insurance or a primary care provider.3
