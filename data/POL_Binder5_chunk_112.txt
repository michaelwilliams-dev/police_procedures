Some Webley Wilkinson 1911 models were made after 1918. All Webley Wilkinson 1911s were numbered in the same series as the Mark VI and WS. During the years 1931 to 1939 Webley renovated and re-numbered over 700 Mk 6 service revolvers which were originally made pre-1919. These revolvers will be found between serial numbers 453101 and 455067 inclusive. Specific information may be obtained from Arms Research Co. 9.14 Other firearms were assembled from parts made before 1919 and where evidence can be shown that this was the case then these firearms may also benefit from section 7(1) and be held as such. 68 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law 9.15 Some manufacturers applied an assembly number, and/or a serial number associated with a particular contract, to each of their firearms. This was in addition to the manufacturerÕs conventional serial number. Confusion over serial numbers is most likely to occur with Smith & Wesson revolvers. Where there is doubt about the correctness of any serial number, specialist advice should be obtained (see Appendix 1). 9.16 In the case of guns that are not listed above, it is open to the owner to present evidence on the date of manufacture of the gun concerned. The police may wish to consider the following kinds of evidence where this is available: (i) The calibre of firearm listed on the firearm certificate; (ii) A factory letter from the makers setting out the date of manufacture; (iii) Extracts from standard reference works giving the date of manufacture of the model; (iv) An insurance or dealerÕs valuation setting out the details of the gun. 9.17 Guns where there have been extensive replacement of components, using parts manufactured after 1 January 1919, should not generally be regarded as having been made before 1919. This would include guns with pre-1919 frames but most other working parts made after that date. However, minor repair work or the replacement of a single part would not invalidate the original date of manufacture.
