implemented, with 15% of revenue allocated to FEMA, capped at $20 million- the equivalent of the upfront aid provided by the Biden- Harris Administration in 2024.16 This funding will support DC underground powerlines as part of climate resilience efforts, minimizing financial burdens on residents. A phased implementation would begin in areas most prone to storm-related outages, aligning with ongoing road construction and utility upgrades. Investments would initially focus on the northern and southernmost states along the East Coast, where immediate investments are required, and slowly work towards a midpoint. By enhancing grid reliance, HVDC power will mitigate catastrophic climate events and establish more stable energy prices for consumers in high-risk areas. Cities like North Redington Beach, Florida, are implementing underground power supply systems in partnership with local power providers such as the Florida Power Corporation.17 Jacksonville, Florida, and surrounding areas are using partnering groups like the Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) to study the cost- effectiveness and feasibility of underground power lines.18 Partnerships like these will be used to incentivize local stakeholders and businesses to invest in underground power infrastructure through government-subsidized contracts. With the help of local policy think tanks, agencies will evaluate the effectiveness of this plan using proportional and integral (PI) simulation modeling. This sophisticated computational approach integrates control systems principles into the analysis of electrical networks.19 This method will enable a detailed evaluation of critical performance metricsâ transmission efficiencies, voltage drops, and line lossesâspecifically within the context of implementing underground High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems.20 The insights from this evaluation will inform targeted spending for future projects.
