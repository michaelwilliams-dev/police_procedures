professional development days, online platforms, or weekend workshops for SETs.13 In addition to a portion of the fund allocated directly to ACT programming, another portion should be allocated for an increase in administrative support, such as hiring instructional aides and support staff to assist SETs with non-teaching tasks and increasing classroom resources and teaching materials.8 Navigating the passage of these grants through Congress presents a significant challenge, especially when considering a GOP-dominated legislature. These grants will receive funding by shifting the budget of the existing IDEA funds, but some lawmakers may view it as an expansion of federal spending or fear that it sets a precedent for budget increases. That said, it is crucial to present this policy initiative effectively, supported by a clear and detailed explanation of budget reallocation. Furthermore, engaging stakeholders such as teachers, unions, administrators, and parents can greatly influence state policymakers to address infrastructure challenges affecting SETÕs poor work environments.14 Fostering a relationship between these groups and state policymakers strengthens policy implementation and ensures the inclusion of diverse perspectives when making significant changes to the status quo.14 The initial states that are granted the funds from the Department of Education should submit annual progress reports and data on teacher retention rates, job satisfaction, and burnout. These grants can receive funding by shifting the current IDEA budget to prioritize these changes. With real- world feedback, more and more states can implement the same steps followed, ultimately correcting the SET shortage throughout the country. Works Cited [1] University, Gwynedd Mercy.
