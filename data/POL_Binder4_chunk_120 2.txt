Italy, access to the EU Blue Card would be expanded by adding eligible jobs and lowering salary requirements to 45% of the annual pension insurance contribution, allowing family unification for Blue Card holders.28 Employing migrant doctors is also a low-cost option that could help achieve Italyâs recommended 7% of GDP spending on health.29 The low cost would alleviate the economic concern that immigrants can trigger a recession, a primary reason for Italian opposition to immigration.26 The SWA would be a centralized policy, enabling Italy to address regional healthcare inequities by strategically placing foreign doctors.30,31 Highlights Italyâs pressing shortage of doctors, which causes a decrease in quality of care, must be addressed to care for its rapidly aging population.1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Italy should implement a Skilled Workers Act to directly recruit foreign doctors from abroad to strategically fill vacancies nationwide that current doctors and students find unattractive.14,15,16,17,18,20,24,26 Recruiting foreign doctors is cost-effective and would enable Italy to achieve their recommended 7% of GDP on public health.29 During recruiting, Italy should advertise the streamlined bureaucratic process that makes migrating to Italy more efficient and attractive.13,27,28 Implementation To engage public opinion and key stakeholders, the Italian government should emphasize the SWAâs potential benefits for patients and healthcare providers. Outreach through media and healthcare advocacy groups could foster community support.32 This support is important to overcome potential objections to the current relatively anti-immigration climate in Italy.33 To gain buy-in from healthcare unions, the government should demonstrate how the SWA complements initiatives that alleviate burdens on current doctors and improve working conditions through the German example. Furthermore, since the policy enables strategic alignment with EU objectives to tackle illegal migration while promoting necessary and legal migration, Italy could receive funding for the SWA through the EUâs Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund.29 EU funding would further reduce cost-based opposition to the policy. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has strong approval ratings and is known for a tough stance on illegal immigration. However, she has shown the ability to advance moderate reform proposals without alienating her anti-immigration supporters.29,34 Meloni has specifically decried immigration while simultaneously taking steps to expand skilled workers in other industries.36 Thus, Prime Minister Meloni and Minister of Health Orazio Schillaci, should use their political capital to introduce the bill in the Chamber of Deputies. Through individual meetings, they should appeal to the left-wing Democratic Party and the centrist Five Star Movement, which collectively accounts for 120 members of the Chamber of Deputies, to increase support. Furthermore, Meloni and Schillaci should encourage young doctors who went on strike to stage rallies in favor of the bill to demonstrate popularity. Young doctors would likely do so because the bill addresses many of the concerns that caused them to strike. To address criticism of immigration, they should emphasize that the policy specifically targets a doctor shortage that Italians alone cannot resolve. By emphasizing this aspect, the Italian government can reduce opposition to the plan and limit hostility towards foreign doctors.32 Additionally, they can highlight how Germany has implemented similar
