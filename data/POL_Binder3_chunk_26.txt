(Quah 2007). Meritocracy and quality control of personnel The complex nature of policing means that the issue of ethics is central to corruption control and placing ethical scrutiny at the heart of recruitment and selection procedures and within in-service training is vital to the development of a policing culture that is intolerant of corruption (Newburn 2015). Quah (2014) credits reliance on meritocracy to recruit more qualified candidates, and training and values to enhance job performance and integrity as a factor in curbing corruption among the Singapore Police Force. Likewise, a transparent recruitment process and a robust selection process for the Hong Kong Police Force was identified as a contributing factor to Hong KongÕs success in curbing police corruption (Hope 2015). The role of civil society A study undertaken by Transparency International UK in 2011-12 found there has been very little involvement of civilian groups or civil society organisations in police corruption reform. The report concluded that Òthere is a major, urgent need for civil society to find more effective ways of contributing to, stimulating and monitoring police anti-corruption effortsÓ (Transparency International 2012). Civil society organisations, including media organisations, can play an important role in police reform efforts (Transparency International 2012). In the past, civil society has played a key role in raising awareness of corruption scandals and driving reform. Community-based policing promotes partnerships between police and communities to address community concerns and ensure that the police respond to the needs of the broader public. This can be facilitated, for example, through setting up community consultation forums (Chne 2010). The success of such initiatives relies on a set of contextual factors such as a minimum degree of order, a conducive political context and support from key actors such as government, the police and civil society (Groenewald & Peake 2004). However, Menocal (2015) notes that Òthere is very little credible evidence regarding the effectiveness of citizen oversight agenciesÓ and there is no evidence to determine whether external accountability mechanisms are more or less effective than internal ones. Ivkovic (2005) further highlights that the role of civil society also has its shortcomings. In short, she says, current oversight tends to be Òassigned to institutions that are temporary (e.g., independent commissions) or sporadic (e.g., the media), institutions whose focus is either too wide or too narrow (e.g., the mayor), or institutions that at best have the authority to examine only some elements of the agencyÕs control system (e.g. citizen reviews)Ó (Ivkovic 2005). She concludes that the challenge is to design an institution, or set of institutions, that will effectively be able to oversee and control the police agencyÕs control system as a whole on a continuous basis. Independent oversight of the police Corruption control is unlikely to be successful without significant attention also being paid to external oversight and governance (Newburn 2015). External accountability mechanisms Ð human rights commissions, citizen complaint and review boards, police auditors Ð are widely heralded as important instruments of police accountability. Indeed, reform efforts are often limited and incomplete
