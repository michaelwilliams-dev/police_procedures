years will be crucial in determining where the UK places its desired level of ambition in AI, as massive investments by governments and businesses around the world are already priming themselves to influence the global conversation. The scale of effort elsewhere must not be underestimated: Germany has committed Û3.1 billion towards a national AI strategy up to 20257, and France has pledged Û1.5 billion up to 2022, with almost half earmarked for research.8 While the UK has played a leading role in the development of AI, the US has recently announced $1 billion over the coming five years to open 12 new institutes that will keep the country at the forefront of research in AI and quantum computing9, and like-minded countries such as Canada and Germany are leading on commercialisation as measured by patents.10 The Council calls for a UK National AI Strategy that creates an even stronger general base of support for AI. Scotland has already embarked on an AI Strategy and the UK strategy should be created in consultation with the devolved administrations and the wider ecosystem. The UK cannot, and need not try to, compete equally in all economic sectors so it must shape its strategy carefully to ensure it prioritises and is able to act selectively to lead and to capture markets around the world. In doing this it will need to consider its options for collaboration and competition within the international scientific and economic landscapes. 4 Some estimates show that leading nations could gain an extra 20-25% in economic growth and productivity gains through AI over the next decade.

This has resulted in four pillars:  support for research, development and innovation;  literacy in AI across the population with enhanced AI-related skills at all levels of educational and lifelong attainment;  sound physical, digital and virtual infrastructure, including robust and flexible regulation as a form of social infrastructure, resulting in good governance that boosts public trust;  and pragmatic approaches to national, cross-sector adoption that meaningfully advances public and private sector applications. This Roadmap sets out the requirements in each of these areas in more detail and builds on the 2017 Hall-Pesenti AI Review.
