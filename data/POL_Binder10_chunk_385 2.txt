For malicious threats, LRFs are recommended to refer directly to the NRR, perhaps by including a link or reproducing the enclosed risks as assessed in the NRR matrix, using a modified form of the language previously recommended, along the following lines: ÒThe NRR is a national picture, derived from the National Risk Assessment, of the risks of emergencies. The Matrix [here] gives an indication of the relative likelihood and impact of the high consequence risks that are outlined in the National Risk Register. It includes the risk of a number of kinds of terrorist attacks, shown here as attacks on crowded places, transport systems, and critical infrastructure, and attacks using non-conventional (or in other words chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) materials. In planning for emergencies [we] take into account the
