the early yearsÓ following emigration.3 While factors such as career prospects lead Irish-trained physicians abroad, throughout post- graduate training, Òthe lack of substantive improvements in conditions back in Ireland ...keeps them abroad.Ó3 The Irish healthcare system could better increase CSCST return by also using the recruitment program to update CSCSTs as NSF implementation results in developments. Highlights  Ireland currently has a surplus of medical students yet an inadequate healthcare workforce.1 IrelandÕs dependence on foreign- trained doctors is problematically drawing doctors away from low and middle-income countries.1 Despite the historical pattern of CSCSTs emigrating for fellowship training and subsequently returning to Ireland, some researchers worry that their emigration is becoming more common and more permanent.1,4  The NDTP should create an international recruitment program for doctors who received their CSCSTs in Ireland. It should contact those who receive their CSCSTs in Ireland but are not actively registered with the IMC when (1) there are recruitment opportunities for consultants and (2) there are improvements made in the Irish healthcare system to encourage their return.  As the NDTP monitors the DIME database for workforce planning, it should monitor the recruitment campaign's targets and conduct surveys of those who return to determine whether the outreach influenced their decision. Implementation The NDTP, which maintains DIME, could implement an international recruitment program. Gaining the support of the NDTPÕs Medical Workforce Planning Lead, Dr. Roisin Morris, and of DIME Project Managers, Orla Smith and Aoife Nolan, would be instrumental in creating this program.6 As the NDTP, the IMC, postgraduate medical training bodies, and clinical sites collaborate to collect DIME data, critical officials in these other organizations must also champion this policy for it to be successful.5 DIMEÕs utility for tracking physicians leaving and returning from Ireland hinges on using each doctorÕs IMC number as a Òunique identifierÓ because it does not change as they migrate.4 As such, ensuring the IMCÕs support in using this information and physician contact details to organize outreach is critical. In particular, obtaining encouragement from the IMCÕs Registration and Continuing Practice Committee could facilitate the fastest possible implementation of the program.7 In addition, one avenue to ensure the aforementioned training bodiesÕ support could be to contact the Forum of Irish Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies, which could promote the policy to all such bodies together.1 In particular, establishing a connection with the Forum Trainee Subcommittee, which aims to improve the Òstandards of postgraduate training,Ó would be beneficial.8 As this subcommittee distributes information to trainees across all bodies, promoting the program through its avenues could increase awareness among trainees and encourage their future engagement with the outreach. Engagement with the aforementioned organizations will most likely lead to engagement with clinical sites. The first step of implementing this policy will be engaging with these four critical organizations which collaborate on DIME. Upon their approval, the NDTP should create the outreach program for CSCSTs abroad. Personnel involved in DIME would assume the extra responsibility of keeping the contact information of CSCSTs abroad up to date
