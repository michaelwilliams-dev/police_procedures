Excellence, Equity, and Enrichment: Spreading the Schoolwide Enrichment Model in Broward County By Sanshray Singh, ss4379@cornell.edu Gifted education is currently implemented in a variable, inequitable fashion, raising concerns about its effectiveness in enhancing student performance. Elementary schools in Broward County should end separated classes for gifted students and implement the SEM method coupled with accelerated instruction. Background Across the country, âgifted and talentedâ programs have received increasing scrutiny over both entrenching socioeconomic inequities through issues with racial diversity and ability to substantively influence student trajectories. 1 Thus, it is important to ensure that such programs are both effective and equitable in their selection of gifted students who need specialized learning resources of these resources. At the elementary school level, Broward County, one of the largest districts in South Florida, currently implements a policy of creating âtrackedâ classes, which are separate classes created for children classified as âgiftedâ by an IQ test score.2 When there are not enough gifted students to fill an entire class, they are combined with âhigh achievingâ students who are not âgiftedâ but have the highest performance in their grade on state- standardized tests of the previous year. These classrooms must have âgifted specific programmingâ and âdifferentiated instruction,â leaving it up to individual schools to develop practices that vary from school to school.2 Thus, differences in tax base (wealthier areas have more municipal money to draw from than poorer areas) may create differences, such as lack of gifted trained staff, lesser access to specialized materials and resources, etc., following trends of lower quality programming for poorer children. A 2019 survey of 2000 elementary schools found that most 3rd grade level teachers were not using differentiated/accelerated instruction in gifted classrooms.2 Research shows that class separation may have
