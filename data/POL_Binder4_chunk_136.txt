barriers. Children also suffer under this system, with 104 cases of child violence documented in 2021, many of which were prematurely closed.12 Current policies, such as the Law on Domestic Violence, still have weak law enforcement that fails to provide adequate protection through restraining orders and prioritizes reconciliation.13 Policy Idea To improve law enforcement's response to domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan, the government should implement a mandatory, ongoing specialized training program that includes the following: Mandatory training for all law enforcement officers on domestic violence, focusing on recognizing psychological and economic abuse as well as physical violence.14 Regular refresher courses are held annually to ensure officers stay up to date on best practices and are fully equipped to handle domestic violence cases effectively.15 Comprehensive curriculum covering the enforcement of restraining orders and prioritizing victim safety over reconciliation, emphasizing rural areas where enforcement is weakest.16 Accountability mechanisms to assess officersâ performance and ensure compliance with the training, including routine evaluations.17 Collaboration with local and international organizations, such as UN Women and Bir Duino (a human rights organization protecting civil liberties and advocating for marginalized groups) to provide resources and support for the training program.18 Policy Analysis The implementation of mandatory, ongoing specialized training for police officers in Kyrgyzstan would enhance law enforcement's ability to respond to domestic and sexual violence cases. A study by the Australian Institute of Criminology demonstrates that training focused on recognizing coercive control (a pattern of controlling behaviors that create an unequal power dynamic), psychological abuse, and economic violence has led to more effective handling of cases, resulting in higher arrest rates and better enforcement of restraining orders.19 Additionally, such training enhances officers' ability to identify the primary aggressor in complex domestic violence situations, helping to reduce repeat offenses and prevent further harm.19 Practical, scenario-based training, including mock interviews and real-life simulations, has been shown to enhance police skills in managing domestic violence cases.19 This training equips officers to navigate the complexities of these situations, leading to higher prosecution rates and more accurate investigations. Incorporating trauma-informed approachesâ which emphasize understanding and sensitivity toward survivorsâ experiencesâfurther improves interactions, reducing victim- blaming and increasing victimsâ willingness to report abuse. A study by the National Policing Institute found that procedural justice training not only reduced crime but also improved public perceptions of the police, which is crucial for building trust with vulnerable populations.20 This model is essential for Kyrgyzstan, where interviews indicate that only about 10% of domestic violence cases are reported to the police via 102. Distrust in law enforcement, cultural stigma, and financial dependence often lead survivors to seek support elsewhere.21 By partnering with organizations like Bir Duino and utilizing resources from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Kyrgyzstan can lower the costs of developing and maintaining police training programs.22 These collaborations provide access to expertise, training materials, and funding that reduce the need for Kyrgyzstan to invest heavily in creating its own training infrastructure.23 Highlights Since ratifying CEDAW in 1997, Kyrgyzstan has struggled to meet
