retirement plans. This federal initiative takes inspiration from successful state-run programs, such as CaliforniaÕs CalSavers. CalSavers automatically enrolls employees who do not have retirement plans at work, making it easier for them to save through options with low administrative demands and portability across jobs. Evaluations of CalSavers show a rapid increase in assets under management, growing from $595 million to $858 million in just a year, which not only highlights its viability but also its potential benefits on a national scale.5 Expanding this model at a federal level could provide millions of lower-wage workers with a stable foundation for financial security in retirement, thereby reducing their dependence on future government aid, such as Social Security, to help stabilize governmental budgets.7 More importantly, automatic enrollment addresses behavioral inertia that can occur when saving is a voluntary choice. Many workers may procrastinate or feel overwhelmed by the process of setting up a retirement plan due to factors like complexity, lack of financial knowledge, and competing priorities. Automatic enrollment eliminates the initial burden of taking action and utilizes behavioral economics principles to help push individuals toward better financial strategy as AARP estimates American workers are 15 times more likely to save if they can save through automatic payroll reduction.8,9 Highlights  Nearly half of private-sector employees lack access to quality retirement saving plans, leaving millions at heightened risk of financial insecurity in old age and increasing economic inequality.1  Federal automatic IRAs address retirement access barriers, especially for low- wage and gig workers lacking employer-sponsored plans.1  Automatic enrollment, overseen by the Treasury and IRS, ensures a seamless setup with payroll deductions, enabling easy contributions and portable accounts across jobs.  Inspired by successful state models like CalSavers, federal IRAs aim to increase savings participation from 66% to 92% among eligible workers.6  Expanding access to retirement savings reduces reliance on government assistance, enhances financial stability, and narrows the wealth gap, benefiting individuals and the economy.7 Implementation Outreach efforts need to be led by state leaders and policymakers who have implemented similar initiatives in states like California, Oregon, Illinois, and others with a history of supporting similar financial programs to gain federal momentum. By engaging representatives from these states, the policy can gain credibility and utilize existing legislative frameworks for efficiency. Additionally, lobbying efforts should target representatives such as Congressman Richard Neal (D- MA), a prominent advocate for automatic IRAs and senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. Congressman NealÕs experience with bipartisan retirement plans and his influence within the committee would be invaluable in shaping and advancing the legislation for expedited passage through the House Committee on Ways and Means.10 With the new Senate dominated by Republicans coming in, framing the policy strategically is key. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat and Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is a critical ally due to his history of bipartisan retirement reforms, including the bipartisan Enhancing American Retirement Act with Republican Senator Mike Crapo.11 WydenÕs role can highlight automatic IRAs as a fiscally sound
