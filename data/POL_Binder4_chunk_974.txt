Homelessness and domestic abuse victimsâ priority need for accommodation Many victims of domestic abuse must leave their homes and the area where they live to escape abuse. Victims who are homeless as a result of domestic abuse have priority need for accommodation. This means local housing authorities have a duty to secure accommodation for victims of domestic abuse if they are homeless through no fault of their own and eligible for assistance. The accommodation provided must be suitable in relation to the applicant and to all members of their household who normally reside with them, or who might reasonably be expected to reside with them.

The approach to the services and support commissioned should consider the particular needs of all victims in the area and authorities must consider their Public Sector Equality Duty under the Equality Act 2010.
