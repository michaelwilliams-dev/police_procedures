and development to justify expenditures, and aligning the budget closely with the Grant Narrative.12 This approach ensures that every dollar is accounted for, supports the proposed objectives, and addresses the specific needs highlighted in the application. By integrating clear, measurable goals into the financial plan, states can present a compelling case for how funds will directly benefit their constituents and achieve the desired outcomes.12 After administering discretionary grant plans for specific states, policymakers can tailor ACT programs to align with the needs of SETs. ACT training should emphasize mindfulness, value-driven action, and psychological flexibility to alleviate burnout in high-stress professions. This training can occur through professional development days, online platforms, or weekend workshops for SETs.13 In addition to a portion of the fund allocated directly to ACT programming, another portion should be allocated for an increase in administrative support, such as hiring instructional aides and support staff to assist SETs with non-teaching tasks and increasing classroom resources and teaching materials.8 Navigating the passage of these grants through Congress presents a significant challenge, especially when considering a GOP-dominated legislature. These grants will receive funding by shifting the budget of the existing IDEA funds, but some lawmakers may view it as an expansion of federal spending or fear that it sets a precedent for budget increases. That said, it is crucial to present this policy initiative effectively, supported by a clear and detailed explanation of budget reallocation. Furthermore, engaging stakeholders such as teachers, unions, administrators, and parents can greatly influence state policymakers to address infrastructure challenges affecting SETâs poor work environments.14 Fostering a relationship between these groups and state policymakers strengthens policy implementation and ensures the inclusion of diverse perspectives when making significant changes to the status quo.14 The initial states that are granted the funds from the Department of Education should submit annual progress reports and data on teacher retention rates, job satisfaction, and burnout. These grants can receive funding by shifting the current IDEA budget to prioritize these changes. With real- world feedback, more and more states can implement the same steps followed, ultimately correcting the SET shortage throughout the country.
