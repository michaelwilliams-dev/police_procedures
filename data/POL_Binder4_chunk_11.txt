as Norway, where the recidivism rate sits at 20%, along with testimonies from stakeholders would make a compelling case for the program.15 In the initial years following the programâs implementation, its success should be monitored, by the DOCCS and independent research organizations, to identify any necessary adjustments. Quantitative data, including data collection on recidivism rates, post-release employment rates, and earnings of participants, should be analyzed to assess the programâs effectiveness. Qualitative data from participants, correctional staff, and employers will also be essential to understanding the programâs impact on individual lives. Implementing a pre-release earnings program in NYS addresses the urgent need for financial stability among incarcerated individuals and is a critical step towards reducing recidivism, fostering successful societal reintegration, and promoting a more equitable justice system.
