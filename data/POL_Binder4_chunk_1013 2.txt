given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication, and an individual should be able to withdraw consent at any time. Consent may not be the most appropriate lawful basis and consideration should be given to each situation; for example processing personal data to comply with a statutory obligation such as a court directive, in this case the lawful basis would be compliance with a legal obligation. If there is a genuine change in circumstances that requires the lawful basis to be amended, this should be documented and the individual informed; for example if consent was used as the original lawful basis, but an unanticipated risk to an individual has become apparent, then the lawful basis can justifiably be changed to vital interest. Further details on lawful basis is provided online by the Information Commissionerâs Office. Where necessary agencies should redact information or consider splitting meetings where it is thought that doing so could reduce the risk to the victims, including children.

This should involve a focus on reflective practice, joint training programmes which bring different organisationsâ staff together, clinical supervision and employee assistance programmes; Demonstrating professional curiosity when engaging service users. Often, victims will make contact with a range of services before disclosing their abuse. These contacts represent opportunities for early intervention, so it is crucial that all staff are trained to recognise domestic abuse and ask the right questions; Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance Creating opportunities for staff to have sight of any positive outcomes, such as case studies or local stories, and being able to link back to families that they had initial contact with, to understand the impact of their work; Recognising the specialised nature of the work, choosing staff who hold specialist qualifications, training, accreditation, or other recognised professional standard which gives parity of status with agency colleagues; and Having a domestic abuse policy in place, complementing the policies held by each individual agency, which addresses
