want to consider whether a local court hearing centre is appropriately equipped to deal with a particular case and could therefore order that it retains the matter. The decision to transfer proceedings rests with the court and the applicant must be prepared to assist the court in making this decision. The judge has the power to transfer an injunction hearing to a different location if he/she believes that adequate security arrangements are not in place. This could include moving it to a different court room where possible or transferring one particular hearing to another court, or transferring the entire case to another court. 19 CPR PD 65 para 1.2. 31 Statutory Guidance Injunctions to Prevent Gang-Related Violence and Gang-Related Drug Dealing 9.5. Courts at which an application may be heard: security considerations Applicants should take security concerns into account throughout the entire injunction process.

Witness care Witnesses who are willing to give evidence in court provide the best form of evidence and, where possible, should be encouraged to come forward. However, witnesses often feel anxious about giving evidence in cases such as these. Their concerns may include the prospect of appearing in court, coming face to face with gang members or being threatened by them.
