middle-income, or underserved Americans and offer fair, non- predatory interest rates.7 CDFIs receive grants from state and local governments and private donors, permitting them to offer more flexible lending terms to upstate New York businesses.8 This policy should be accomplished via specific grants given to CDFIs looking to expand their operations. The money can come from New Yorkâs budget surplus of $2.2 billion, thus avoiding undue stress on taxpayers.9 Policy Analysis The goal of this policy is to expand CDFIs to stimulate upstate New Yorkâs economy. New York currently has 80 CDFIs, but according to New Yorkâs Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, this number is insufficient to drive significant economic growth.10 CDFIs are specifically important because their funds are earmarked for underserved communities and struggling businesses.11 Governor Cook emphasizes that many existing CDFIs are focused on economic rebuilding from the destruction of the pandemic, with resources stretched too thin to foster new growth.12 For New York to capitalize on CDFI funding as a tool for expansion, a policy passed by the State Legislature and signed by the Governorâs Office providing more focused funding via grants is essential. While there were some positive byproducts of COVID-19 economic policies â such as the introduction of the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility and Community Reinvestment Act, which allowed CDFIs to build greater capital reserves â these measures only provided a baseline that underemphasizes development along the I-90 corridor.13 Without such growth, the related economic chaos may imperil the potential success of the CHIPS Act. Additional government financial support is needed. The Governor of New York holds budgetary powers to inject fresh energy into the economy. For example, in early March, NY Governor Kathy Hochul passed the $800 million COVID-19 Pandemic Small Business Recovery Grant Program to help floundering businesses.14 But the current policy must go beyond rescuing â it must actively bolster new businesses in underperforming areas, like the Interstate-90 corridor. CDFIs can work quickly in giving this boost, as typically smaller, struggling organizations now face fewer barriers to entry from CDFIs, whose jobs are intrinsically to save failing businesses.15 As such, a legislator- created policy to provide greater funding to CDFIs primarily providing their services to I-90 corridor businesses is required. Highlights In 2023, the Interstate-90 corridor, a key trade and transportation route spanning New York State, was selected as a national technology hub under the federal CHIPS and Science Act.1,2 Business growth in the I-90 corridor remains stagnant, hindered by insufficient government support that can diminish the impact of the CHIPS Act.3,4 New York should fund and deepen access to Community Development Financial Institutions by providing them with lump- sum grants carved from the state budget.7 CDFIs target smaller businesses that serve underserved populations, revitalizing struggling businesses and areas.9 Implementation The CDFI grant program will be application-based, requiring Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to prove how they plan to support new economic development and outline a detailed funding roadmap. This approach builds on the successful model of New Yorkâs Small Business
