with powerful performance targets. While no one method has emerged as the best way forward (nor can any of them claim to have been successfully implemented as yet), it would seem that most of them can work together if the effort is made to do so. It would also seem that engaging police officers directly in the strategic decision-making would support and encourage them in their operational decision-making as well. All of this requires a comprehensive and dramatic commitment to change from the police organisation and central government, which as yet does not seem to be the case.
