violence from a partner; possession of a controlled substance belonging to an abusive partner; use of force against an abusive partner or ex-partner; failure to ensure school attendance for fear of meeting an abusive partner or ex-partner.188 Agencies should always consider the possible context of domestic abuse in female offending and emphasise a gender and trauma-responsive approach for supporting women at risk of entering the criminal justice system.

Victims with insecure immigration status Perpetrators of domestic violence can use insecure immigration status as a way to inflict abuse on the victim, for example, by way of threatening to tell the police or Home Office. When dealing with victims with insecure immigration status, police should treat all individuals who report domestic abuse as victims first. See the âImmigration status and migrant victimsâ section for guidance as to what support victims with insecure immigration status may be able to access. 186 The College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice on Domestic Abuse provides guidance on the use of, and selection of, interpreters at the scene and during interviews. 187 As outlined in the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime in England and Wales (âthe Victims Codeâ), November 2020: victim, or witness, might need the help of a Registered Intermediary because of their age, a learning disability, a mental disorder or a physical disability that affects their ability to communicate.
