and sensitivity (see Annex C). It is believed that FGM may happen to girls in the UK as well as overseas. Girls of school age who are subjected to FGM overseas are likely to be taken abroad (often to the familyÕs country of origin) at the start of the school holidays, particularly in the summer, in order for there to be sufficient time for her to recover before returning to school. There are a number of factors in addition to a girlÕs or womanÕs community, country of origin and family history that could indicate she is at risk of being subjected to FGM. Potential risk factors may include:  a female child is born to a woman who has undergone FGM;  a female child has an older sibling or cousin who has undergone FGM;  a female childÕs father comes from a community known to practise FGM;  the family indicate that there are strong levels of influence held by elders and/or elders are involved in bringing up female children;  a woman/family believe FGM is integral to cultural or religious identity;  a girl/family has limited level of integration within UK community;  parents have limited access to information about FGM and do not know about the harmful effects of FGM or UK law;  a girl confides to a professional that she is to have a Ôspecial procedureÕ or to attend a special occasion to Ôbecome a womanÕ; 40 | Multi-agency statutory guidance on female genital mutilation  a girl talks about a long holiday to her country of origin or another country where the practice is prevalent (see Section 2.3 for the nationalities that traditionally practise FGM);  parents state that they or a relative will take the girl out of the country for a prolonged period;  a parent or family member expresses concern that FGM may be carried out on the girl;  a family is not engaging with professionals (health, education or other);  a family is already known to social care in relation to other safeguarding issues;  a girl requests help from a teacher or another adult because she is aware or suspects that she is at immediate risk of FGM;  a girl talks about FGM in conversation, for example, a girl may tell other children about it (see Annex G for commonly used terms in different languages) Ð it is important to take into account the context of the discussion;  a girl from a practising community is withdrawn from Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education or its equivalent;  a girl is unexpectedly absent from school;  sections are missing from a girlÕs Red book; and/or  a girl has attended a travel clinic or equivalent for vaccinations / anti-malarials. Remember: this is not an exhaustive list of risk factors. There may be additional risk factors specific to particular communities. For example, in certain communities FGM is closely associated to when a girl reaches a particular age.
