cases. Titled "Research on the Missing", the study, which has been periodically updated since its release, sought to map out cases in the state in order to identify, on the one hand, the profile of "missing persons" and, on the other, the circumstances and possible causes of their disappearance. Among the results, there is one information frequently evoked at the SDP: both in the original study's sample and in its follow-ups, over 70% of cases ended with the "missing persons" returning to their homes or at least with their whereabouts being identified. 19 In the dissertation that resulted from the research (Ferreira, 2011, p.94-112), there is a detailed reflection on this enigmatic character and its relationship with the documents' material elements. For reasons of economy, the issue will not be explored here.
