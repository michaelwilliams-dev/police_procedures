example, if the decision is taken not to arrest but to obtain an early voluntary account under caution from the suspect (to focus the enquiry) 4 PACE, Code G, (Note 2G). there may be limited information available to disclose to the suspect, possibly little more than the offence under investigation, the purpose of the interview and there being no necessity to arrest. 5 The conduct of a voluntary interview (with the exception of special warnings) is no different to that of a person under arrest and should be completed accordingly to achieve clear relevant objectives. In conclusion the impact of Code G does not reduce the significance of a suspect√ïs interview nor should it reduce its quality. The necessity to arrest and the necessity to interview are entirely separate and matters of professional judgement to be exercised on a case-by-case basis.
