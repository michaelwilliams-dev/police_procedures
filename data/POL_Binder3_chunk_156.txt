against anyone; OR  a fixed penalty notice in lieu of prosecution is issued in respect of the same offence, the vehicle keeperÕs liability to pay the civil penalty notice is discharged and the civil penalty notice cannot be pursued further. This applies whether or not any prosecution is successful. 11J.9 Therefore, if a civil penalty notice is issued and the recipient then provides evidence as to the identity of the litterer, the enforcing authority will need to consider whether this is a sufficiently compelling reason to cancel the original civil penalty (see paragraphs 11N.22 to 11N.38). The enforcing authority may also (separately) decide whether sufficient evidence has been provided to pursue criminal enforcement action (a fixed penalty notice or prosecution) against the alleged litterer. However, only one Ð or no Ð penalty notice may be issued and pursued in respect of a single littering offence. Form of civil penalty notices 11J.10 A penalty notice for littering from a vehicle must state all of the following:  the circumstances alleged to constitute the littering offence in question, including the registration mark (if known) of the vehicle concerned  how long they have to pay the penalty (28 days from the date the penalty notice is given)11  the amount of the penalty if paid within 28 days  that the amount of the penalty will double if not paid within 28 days  that the enforcing litter authority may recover any penalty not paid within 28 days in court  [If applicable] details of any early-payment discount available if the penalty is paid within 14 days (including the amount of the discounted penalty, which must not be less than £50)  details of how to pay (the name and address of the person to whom payment must be made, and the permissible methods of payment)  that the recipient has a right to make representations to the enforcing litter authority  the grounds on which representations may be made; and  in general terms, how an appeal to an adjudicator can be made 11J.11 The description of the circumstances to constitute the littering offence should include a description of the litter alleged to have been deposited. Cameras, recording devices and evidence from the public 11J.12 Enforcement action may be taken on the basis of evidence supplied by members of the public provided that, in the opinion of the enforcing authority, the evidence is sufficient to meet the relevant standards of proof. Enforcing authorities may decide to adopt a policy of only issuing a notice based on multiple public reports of litter from the same vehicle, or a pattern of behaviour. 11J.13 If evidence from a recording device (such as a CCTV camera or dash-cam in one of your own vehicles) is intended to be used in appeal proceedings relating to civil penalties for littering from vehicles, the enforcing authority will need to produce the recording(s), and a certificate stating the circumstances in which the record was produced must be provided
