More than one individual may be nominated under subsection (5) or (6) (but not in relation to the same relevant person or description of relevant persons). The group must permit any individuals nominated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this subsection to attend meetings of the group as observers. 24AH Functions of security executive groups The security executive group for an aerodrome mustâ decide the contents of each aerodrome security plan for the aerodrome, and keep the contents of each plan under review and decide whether (and, if so, how) they should be varied. No provision may be included in an aerodrome security plan unless all the members of the group unanimously agree that it should be included. An aerodrome security plan may not be varied unless all the members of the group unanimously agree to the variation. But the agreement of a member is not required for the purposes of subsection (2) or (3) if the member unreasonably fails to inform the other members of the group whether the member agrees or disagrees to the inclusion of the provision or (as the case may be) to the variation.
