Epilepsy Behav 10:611-4. 9 57. Police officers should be aware of the possibility that some displays of aggression and violence by individuals may be linked to an underlying epilepsy disorder. This would be particularly relevant in situations in which a person is known by the police to be affected by epilepsy, where post-incident medical intervention should be sought as early as possible. 58. People with diabetes who have marked hypoglycaemia can display confusion, drowsiness, changes in behaviour, coma and seizure. Under certain circumstances, these symptoms and signs may lead to the use of Taser. Officers should be alert to the possibility that altered behaviour may be linked to poorly controlled blood sugar and seek medical assistance if in doubt. 59. Individuals for whom English is not their first language may have an impaired comprehension of spoken English and, as a result, may not respond appropriately to instructions issued by police officers. This may raise the risk of Taser and other forms of force being used within this group and consequently may increase injury rates. Similar communication barriers (and potential for increased injury rates) may apply to those who are hearing impaired or who have significant visual impairment. Special considerations among those with mental ill health, learning difficulties, neurodevelopmental conditions or neurobehavioural conditions 60. Mental ill health, learning difficulties, neurodevelopmental conditions or neurobehavioural conditions have the potential to negatively influence how affected individuals interact with the police.35 For this reason, there is the possibility that people in these groups may be at an elevated risk of exposure to Taser discharge or to other forms of force and may experience higher injury rates as a consequence. 61. The short-, medium- or longer-term psychological impact of exposure to the Taser system, and of adverse interactions with the police in general, are unexplored. In this respect, children may be more (or less) vulnerable than adults. Deaths associated with the use of the Taser 62. Amnesty International has published a report documenting 334 deaths in the United States that were associated temporally with application of Taser discharge.36 63. The report summarises autopsy findings for 283 of the 334 deaths. In 203 of these, three factors emerge as having been causal or contributory in the deaths: (a) drugs (mostly cocaine or methamphetamine), (b) alcohol, and (c) some form of delirium (variously described as agitated psychosis, excited delirium or psychotic delirium). 64. Heart disease, positional asphyxia (due to the method of police restraint), head trauma and cardiac arrhythmia/arrest feature prominently among
