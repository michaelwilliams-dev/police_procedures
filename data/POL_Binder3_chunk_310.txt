the location, price range, and type of home that can be purchased with a shared appreciation mortgage. For example, Arlington, VirginiaÕs program does not allow homes to be bought with a shared appreciation mortgage if its price exceeds $500,000.9 This helps to finetune shared appreciation mortgage programs to align with housing market dynamics in a given location. The application process should be as accessible and streamlined as possible to encourage high participation rates. Multiple application pathways, including an online form and a paper application that can be mailed or submitted in person, will accommodate diverse applicant needs. It is imperative to conduct outreach in communities with low homeownership rates. Creating social media adverts, posting flyers in physical spaces, hosting informational town halls, and collaborating with other public entities to spread information are all potential methods of performing such outreach. By implementing these key strategies, local governments can create a more equitable homeownership environment for all.

Federal Automatic IRA for an Easy Retirement By Simone Chan, sc3336@cornell.edu Federal implementation of automatic Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) helps address gaps in retirement savings access, particularly for marginalized workers. Making saving a default option can help secure millions of AmericansÕ financial stability and contribute to the nationÕs economic success. Background Employer-based retirement plays a major role in securing financial welfare for American workers. However, according to the AARP Public Policy Institute, around 55 million employees in the private sector Ð equivalent to nearly half Ð work for an employer that does not offer a retirement plan.1 Many employers, especially small businesses, face cost barriers when offering retirement plans.2 About 32 million workers in small businesses did not have access to a retirement plan, compared to about 23 million in businesses with 100 or more workers.2 Workers
