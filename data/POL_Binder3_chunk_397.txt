operations to ensure accountability within the National Guard. Policy Analysis Mexico adopting IACHR recommendations will help combat human rights abuses by establishing a framework for Mexico to implement accountability reforms. For example, in 2019, the IACHR ruled that Mexico must adopt a law regarding the use of force per international human rights standards.3 In the same year, Mexico adopted the National Law on the Use of Force, which requires detailed reporting and accountability measures for superiors in cases of unlawful force.3 IACHR concluded that Mexico has fully adhered to their suggestion ever since.5 While Mexico implemented this IACHR recommendation, SheinbaumÕs fervent support for militarization conveys that the Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies should lobby for the president to implement more IACHR reforms to address the National GuardÕs human rights abuses, given that they are the direct channel between communities experiencing human rights violations and the government. Although Mexico has adopted some IACHR reforms, further action is needed to hold the National Guard accountable. IACHRÕs involvement in the Barrios Alto case in Peru demonstrates how their reforms can hold Latin American militaries accountable. On November 3rd, 1991, Peruvian military officials killed 15 people in the Barrios Alto neighborhood on false suspicions of terrorism.6 Later, the Peruvian Congress adopted an amnesty law that exonerated army members who committed human rights violations between 1980 and 1995.6 In 2001, the IACHR ruled that PeruÕs law violated the American Convention on Human Rights.6 Following the ruling, Peru created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR) to monitor human rights violations, and in 2005, the CVR formalized the Comprehensive Reparations Plan which compensates individuals who were subjects of human rights violations.7 Given MexicoÕs ongoing inability to hold its National Guard accountable, oversight from the IACHR is a logical approach to convince Sheinbaum to implement more accountability reforms. Highlights  Mexico has struggled to balance militarizing its National Guard and addressing the Organization of American StatesÕ Inter- American Commission on Human RightsÕ concerns over human rights abuses in the military.  Mexican senators and deputies who are not members of Mexican President Claudia SheinbaumÕs Sigamos Haciendo Historia political alliance should lobby the President to implement IACHRÕs reforms to hold the National Guard accountable.  Mexico has successfully implemented some IACHR reforms relating to human rights in the past, such as the National Law on the Use of Force, which Mexico has consistently been adhering to since its implementation in 2019.  IACHRÕs involvement in the Barrios Alto case in Peru, which saw Peru create the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to monitor human rights violations in 2001 after military officials killed 15 people on false suspicions of terrorism in 1991, demonstrates its ability to hold Latin American military officials accountable to human rights. Implementation Implementing reforms to the National Guard will require deputies from different parties not affiliated with Sigamos Haciendo Historia, such as Vctor Manuel Prez Daz of the National Action Party and Laura Hernndez Garca of the CitizensÕ Movement, to begin lobbying support in MexicoÕs lower
