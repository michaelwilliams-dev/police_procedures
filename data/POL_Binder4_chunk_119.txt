healthcare worker contract renewals after years of underinvestment; however, this funding fails to fully address the healthcare shortage.4 Only one-third of contracts were filled between 2023 and 2024, despite increased training contracts over the past three years.4 Current residentsâ criticisms of the Italian residency system may disincentivize the already small population of Italian students from entering the industry.6 Many European countries have implemented specific policies to recruit doctors to alleviate shortages.8,10,11 In contrast, Italy has not introduced a comprehensive plan to do so and has one of the lowest percentages of foreign doctors, at 0.9%.12 The Italian government is generally anti- immigration and has not taken cohesive action to recruit migrant workers.13 Further, language barriers, slow recognition of foreign degrees, and the complex process for obtaining a visa are barriers for interested migrant doctors.14,15,16 Italy should consider taking cohesive steps to recruit foreign doctors to address its current healthcare shortage. Policy Idea While Italy is increasing medical school enrollment, they cannot fill all vacant positions with students alone.17 To address the immediate shortage of doctors and mitigate the associated risks for providers and patients, the Italian government should implement a modified version of Germanyâs Skilled Workers Act (SWA). This centralized policy would increase the recruitment of foreign doctors to fill vacant positions that students are unable or unwilling to fill. Italy would directly recruit of foreign doctors, which is not currently part of the German SWA, and advertise the advantages of their new streamlined migration process. These advantages include reducing language training barriers, recognizing degrees from abroad, and increasing access to EU Blue Cards. Policy Analysis Italy recognizes that increasing migration and expanding its workforce are necessary to reverse the migratory trend that began with a surplus of doctors.18,19,20 Italy has an interest in bolstering the medical industry and, despite its anti-immigration stance, has taken steps to increase migrant doctors, raising the likelihood of an Italian SWA.18,20 Development-oriented partnerships that recruit foreign workers by promoting location and settlement program advantages are effective, leveraging existing initiatives without incurring additional costs.21,22,23 This recruitment would give Italy an edge, as countries like Germany do not recruit directly.21 Recruitment benefits Italy, as policy shifts alone do not trigger migratory pull effects.24 The lack of pull effects would alleviate concerns about illegal immigration from the policy, allowing directly recruited migrant doctors to fill roles that students and current doctors avoid due to their unattractiveness.25,26 Recruitment would be effective because the SWA tackles obstacles disincentivizing skilled worker migration. The SWA would increase funding for teaching Italian abroad and supporting Italian abroad upon arrival.13,27 Furthermore, more foreign degrees would be recognized faster, and vocational training would fill gaps to meet Italian standards.13,27 Once foreign doctors are in Italy, access to the EU Blue Card would be expanded by adding eligible jobs and lowering salary requirements to 45% of the annual pension insurance contribution, allowing family unification for Blue Card holders.28 Employing migrant doctors is also a low-cost option that could help achieve Italyâs recommended 7% of GDP
