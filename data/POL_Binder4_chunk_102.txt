already existing organizational structures, with divisions such as the Division of Financial Practices currently focusing on emerging technology broadly.6 Establishing data disclosure requirements would similarly pressure corporations to adhere to equitable pricing schemes. Structuring a data disclosure requirement similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would require companies to disclose what data is being collected and for what purpose.7 The efficacy of this policy is demonstrated by the effects of GDPR, with a survey of EU citizens finding that 60% of respondents were aware of their ability to access personal data held by public administrations, and 51% were aware of their ability to access data held by private companies.8 This requirement would check back against one of the major concerns regarding surveillance pricing: lack of transparency on how algorithms determine individual pricing.9 The benefits of data disclosure requirements extend beyond consumer protection. Finally, creating a third- party auditing and certification system would help incentivize companies to adhere to new algorithmic pricing regulations by enabling the attainment of a displayable certificate. Additionally, a third-party auditing system would reduce the administrative load placed on the FTC: by focusing on certifying accrediting services rather than performing audits, the FTC would experience the same outcomes for a fraction of the workload. Third- party audits additionally increase consumer confidence, with a Deloitte report finding that 78% of respondents believe that third-party audits enhance the credibility of a company's financial and other disclosure practices.10 Highlights The creation of algorithmically determined individualized prices poses potential risks to consumer welfare, including violating national discrimination laws, exploiting unaware consumers, and creating monopolies. Personalized pricing models are not necessarily predatory; fair and balanced pricing systems can maximize profit margins, increase accessibility to goods and services, and enhance market competitiveness. Achieving this balance requires government oversight and safeguards to ensure transparency, anti- discriminatory development, and consumer privacy. Through a three-pronged approach including the founding of a new algorithmic marketing investigative division, the creation of data disclosure requirements for algorithmic pricing schemes, and the introduction of a third-party accrediting system for consumer data usage, the FTC can effectively provide clarity to the field of algorithmic pricing models. Implementation A multi-phased and chronological approach is necessary. The FTC should first establish the proposed surveillance pricing investigative division within the BCP. This division would leverage resources from existing divisions, particularly the Office of Technology given its established focus on advising the FTC on policy and research initiatives in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and human- computer interaction.11 To ensure the success of this new division, the BCP should allocate additional funding and personnel, recruiting experts focused on algorithmic transparency, consumer privacy, and data ethics. The division would become responsible for monitoring emerging algorithmic pricing practices, enforcing the data disclosure standards outlined in prong two of this policy, and providing an accessible reporting system for consumers affected by discriminatory pricing practices. Given the upcoming administrationâs focus on deregulation and reducing expenditures, the FTC may need to first begin with voluntary partnerships and
