the customer information to be provided, having regard to the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation if the information is obtained. Particular action to be taken before an application for a customer information order is made 126. The appropriate officer must carefully consider his existing evidence and information so as to limit the number or scope of financial institutions. This may include researching NCAÕs intelligence system and the Police National Computer. They must consider what benefit the customer information they may obtain may have, either in itself or as the lead to other avenues of investigation. They must also consider whether the information they wish to gain could not be acquired as effectively and efficiently from material which could be obtained by way of a production order. The appropriate officer should consider the cost both to their employer and the financial institutions in complying with the order. 127. The appropriate officer should particularly consider the proportionality of requesting the customer information, against the believed benefit to the investigation. They must also consider the broader issues of law enforcement such as the benefit to the community of removing the suspected proceeds from circulation.
