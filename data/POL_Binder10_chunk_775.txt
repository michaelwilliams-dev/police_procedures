EXPLANATION OF AN ASSOCIATION REQUIRING DECLARATION Only associations where you have a personal relationship with an individual or group require declaration. This would include a person you are related to, a person you would regard as a friend or someone you have planned social meetings with on a regular basis. It should be noted that an association need not necessarily involve face to face meetings. A personal relationship where contact is made using the internet (online) or telephony system in the form of conversation, written messages and/or pictures (whether moving or still images) will still constitute an association. An association does not include a chance meeting. This is defined as an unplanned meeting with an acquaintance who you will only acknowledge, albeit this may be a regular occurrence. An association also does not include individuals with whom the officer or staff member has a purely professional, on duty relationship; or personal relationships with other serving members of the Police Service.
