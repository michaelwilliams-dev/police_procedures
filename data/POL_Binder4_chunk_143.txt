minimal given the high proportion of FIT kits in each machine and few costs associated with the actual tests.23 In addition, the kiosk administration should coordinate with laboratories that already process FIT kits or create new centralized laboratory settings to process incoming stool samples.16 After the kit has been tested, creating a follow-up process that minimizes participantsâ potential emotional strain in the case of positive results will be crucial. Therefore, trained community health workers from partnered health organizations should deliver positive FIT results in the manner most preferred by the participant and inform them of accessible colonoscopy options if necessary.16 Overall, proper implementation of this policy through a wide array of constituent support will lead to diminished CRC racial disparities.
