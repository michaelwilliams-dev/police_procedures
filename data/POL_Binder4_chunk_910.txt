particularly where this may carry a stigma in the community; Preventing the victim from learning a language or making friends outside of their ethnic or cultural background; Threatening precarious immigration status against the victim, withholding documents, giving false information to a victim about their visa or visa application, e.g. using immigration law to threaten the victim with potential deportation; Using the victimâs health status to induce fear and restrict their freedom of movement; Threats of institutionalisation (particularly for disabled or elderly victims); and Physical violence, violent or threatening behaviour, sexual abuse, emotional or psychological abuse, economic abuse and verbal abuse (as further detailed in this chapter). Controlling or coercive behaviour is a pattern of behaviour often perpetrated alongside other forms of abuse. A victim may not be aware of the abusive behaviours or be prepared to make a disclosure. In supporting victims to address controlling or coercive behaviour, agencies should give consideration to the cumulative impact of a Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance perpetratorâs behaviours (including those that may seem harmless) and the pattern of behaviour within the context of the relationship.

He thought I was seeing other people at work. Because of my job I had to take time off if heâd beaten me up really bad. I didnât want anyone to know. But sometimes I would use the old lines that Iâd accidentally fallen down the stairs or walked into a door. Silly things. Maybe they all knew. But no one ever said.â Because she was dependent on her partner to get to work this often meant he refused to take her or she was late and, coupled with the time off she had when sheâd been physically assaulted, this caused problems with her employer. Eventually they said that she had to leave as she was too unreliable to be part of the team. âThis was my
