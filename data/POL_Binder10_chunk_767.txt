record and tick the ÔNon-standardÕ box o In this case ALWAYS email the DQT to advise them so the Gazetteer can be updated Verifying existing business addresses: This can include historic or current businesses.  Before verifying make a note of the exact business name on the existing record  If the address on the Gazetteer doesnÕt include the business name or the business name is incorrect then verify as the appropriate premises name (including exact unit/building name or number) and then manually add or change the business name to what it was originally and tick the ÔNon-standardÕ box o Always email the DQT to advise them so they can check the address and arrange for the Gazetteer to be updated as appropriate Table of Contents 3.1.6 Incorrect / Incomplete addresses These records are commonly created because the address or postcode has been misheard  Confirm the address with the RP/requesting officer  Check the address using Fast Address Client/ Hopewiser/ verification Gazetteer or the Post Office address finder website (section 11)  Google isnÕt always correct so donÕt always trust the first result you find o ItÕs often best to visit the company website where available  Missing beat codes Ð for any address that does not verify via the Gazetteer (ÔNon- standard) all four beat codes will need to be manually added o Always use F3 in one of the beat code fields to search for and auto-populate 3.1.7 Linking/updating existing person records  Having a matching DOB isnÕt enough to confirm a record is the correct person.

Changing a personÕs information can impact existing investigations. If they are linked to multiple occurrences be 100% sure the information is correct and that they are the correct person before updating any part of a record o Missing DOB can be added to their filename o When adding the correct DOB to a person linked to multiple occurrences this must initially be added as a new ÔAliasÕ and then changed to the ÔFilenameÕ, amending the
