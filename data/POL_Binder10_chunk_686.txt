as time off for dependants, to provide assistance if their spouse or civil partner falls ill. Individuals should tell us the reason for their absence as soon as possible and say how long they expect to be off work. Further details are set out in the Dependents Leave Policy. In addition to unpaid time off, the partner of an employee who has a stillbirth, or the father/parent of the baby who has passed away, may be eligible for:  either one or two weeks' statutory paternity leave and pay (further information is set out in our Support Leave policy Ð see section 8)   up to two weeks' statutory parental bereavement leave and pay, which can be taken as two separate weeks or a single period of leave (further information is set out in our Parental Bereavement Leave section) and;  5 days' paid leave under our Compassionate Leave Policy 4.10 The role of colleagues If a colleague is experiencing a miscarriage while they are at work, fellow colleagues should respond sympathetically and supportively. Practical steps that you can take include:  ensuring that they have privacy and access to a toilet;  providing a wrap or covering if they are bleeding heavily;  arranging transport home or to a hospital as appropriate (including calling an ambulance if this is necessary and arranging for someone to accompany them);  calling their partner or a friend to notify them of the situation, if this is what they want; and  reassuring them not to worry about work and that arrangements to cover their work will be made. We recognise that an individual whose partner is having a miscarriage or stillbirth may need to leave work at short notice and arrangements will be made to accommodate this. If a colleague has chosen to share information about a miscarriage or stillbirth, when they return to work employees should offer them sympathy and support and acknowledge their loss. The Miscarriage Association has published Supporting someone you know, which contains guidance on how to talk sensitively about miscarriage in the workplace.
