o w n e r o r occupier and any other person entitled to grant access are known to be absent; or  there are reasonable grounds for believing that to alert the owner, occupier or any other person entitled to grant access by attempting to communicate with them would frustrate the object of the search or endanger the person concerned or other people. 92. Before a search begins, the appropriate person must identify him or herself (subject to the provision in section 449A relating to pseudonyms of members of staff of the relevant Director) and show an official form of identification, state the purpose of the search and the grounds for undertaking it. The appropriate person does not need to comply with this provision if the circumstances detailed in paragraph 92 apply. Notice of powers and rights 93. The appropriate person must, unless it is impracticable to do so, provide the owner of or occupier of, or other person entitled to grant access to the premises with a copy of the warrant and in addition to the matters specified in paragraph 36, a notice30:  summarising the extent of the powers of search and seizure conferred in POCA; and  stating that a copy of this code is available to be consulted and giving a contact point at which it can be obtained. 94.
