Performance assessment criteria All stab resistant armour, regardless of protection level, shall not exceed the penetration limits defined in Table 13 for the associated protection level being assessed. 7.1.2. Fair strike A fair strike shall be recorded if:  the energy of the stab falls within the defined tolerance in Table 14;  the stab placement rules, defined in Table 12, are adhered to;  unless otherwise specified, the stab is perpendicular to the target. Any strike that does not meet the fair strike criteria will be classed as unfair and repeated unless covered by exceptions in Section 7.1.3. 7.1.3. Exceptions The following conditions represent exceptions to the fair strike criteria for stab testing:  If the stab energy is below the specified range but the depth of penetration limits are exceeded; this shall be classed as a fair strike.  If the stab energy is above the specified range and the depths of penetration requirements are met; this may be classed as a fair strike upon acceptance by the manufacturer. Beyond this point, any subsequent fair strikes are considered acceptable.  If the stab placement rules are not adhered to and the depth of penetration requirements are met; this may be classed as a fair strike upon acceptance by the manufacturer. Beyond this point, any subsequent fair strikes are considered acceptable. If the manufacturer considers an unfair strike, which they have not accepted, to have compromised the continued performance of the panel under test they may request that a full re-test of that panel is completed. In these circumstances, the manufacturer shall provide an additional panel to the test facility for testing. 7.1.4. Strike placement rules Strikes shall be positioned according to strike rules outlined in Table 12.

Protection levels There are two knife protection levels, each of which can be upgraded to include spike protection. For each knife protection level, two stab energies are assessed, E1 and E2. Spike is only assessed at E1. The test energies and associated permissible depths of penetration are shown in Table 13. For each knife protection level there is a single penetration limit (SPL), which defines a maximum permissible penetration for a single stab in a test series.
