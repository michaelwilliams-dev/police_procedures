Guaranteeing Flexibility for Employees on Election Day By Samuel Stille, ss3787@cornell.edu To augment voter participation, the federal government should designate Election Day as a national holiday and mandate paid voting leave for workers. Background High voter turnout is the linchpin of any flourishing democracy, and failure to provide all American voters with flexible voting options compromises it. These options can include vote-by- mail, expanded early voting initiatives, and extended polling hours on Election Day. To improve our democratic system, the government must cultivate an electoral framework that accommodates the diverse needs of its electorate. As of 2022, 21 states had no laws providing workers with time off to vote, while an additional 6 states had statutes requiring leave for voting without accompanying payment.1 The lack of government involvement in promoting election participation leaves voters at the mercy of their employers. In states without paid leave, lower-income voters may deem the opportunity cost of voting to be higher than the benefit, opting instead to work an additional shift to accrue income. Furthermore, rapacious bosses in states without voter leave mandates may disregard their employeesâ voting aspirations and assign them exigent work on Election Day. These phenomena contribute to the disparities in voter turnout rates between socioeconomic strata. The 2016 presidential election illustrated socioeconomic disparities in voter turnout, with only 46% of individuals with family incomes below twice the federal poverty line voting, in contrast to 68% of those whose incomes exceeded that threshold.2 Guaranteeing paid time off for workers would ensure that those living paycheck to paycheck have equal voting opportunities,
