and so we expect minimal new cases to arise. Under the proposals section 3A would include extra territorial jurisdiction provisions for the first time, however we do not expect a significant increase in cases brought under this section. It is expected that the UK is only likely to use this provision where a UK National commits a serious offence in another country that does not impact on the UK (as this is already covered through 'significant link to UK' provisions in section 4), and where the offence was also an offence in the country where ii took place. In practice, use would be considered on a case by case basis and there would be no obligation on the UK to exercise these provisions in any give.n case. We would either need cooperation from the other state to extradite the individual or else arrest on return to the UK. The UK may also receive requests from other EU states to aid in the extradition of foreign nationals. The courts would determine compliance on a case by case basis. The Ministry of Justice have provided the following estimated units costs to illustrate the potential cost of extending territorial jurisdiction to existing Computer Misuse Act offences.

Given that all Computer Misuse Act offences are triable either way, data about the numbers tried in each court for all Computer Misuse Act offences was used to estimate the proportion of people tried Magistrates and Crown Court. Data from 2012 shows that approximately 41% of Computer Misuse Act cases were tried in the Magistrates Court and 59% in the Crown Court. Data also shows that across all Computer Misuse Act offences approximately 30% of offenders are sentenced to immediate custody and 50% to community orders and suspended sentence orders. It is assumed that this will be the same for any future Computer Misuse Act offences committed outside the UK but prosecuted in the UK by extending jurisdiction. Upper bound for extra territorial jurisdiction = £235k per case
