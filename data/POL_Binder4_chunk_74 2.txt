year-olds, and many states have since begun implementing state-funded pre-K programs.1,2 However, these programs have had an unforeseen consequence, putting their benefits at risk and threatening to further degrade our already fraught early childhood system. As public pre-K expands, it drives childcare providers out of business, exacerbating preexisting childcare deserts and driving up childcare costs.3,4 One study found that implementation of public pre-K in NYC reduced one day care seat for every seven four-year-olds who enrolled in the program; alarmingly, every seat lost was in a high- poverty area. The quality of centers near public pre-K facilities also diminished.4 In Tulsa, Oklahoma, where 70% of four-year-olds are enrolled in public pre-K, 43% of all licensed ECCE providers have closed and ECCE costs have risen by an average of 33%.5,6 This issue occurs because private childcare providers derive nearly all of their profit from three- and four-year-olds â providing infant and toddler care actually loses money due to the high staff-to-children ratio it requires.7 The rise of publicly funded pre-K has diminished the number of preschool-aged children in private care, despite the sustained demand for infant and toddler care. A study of nine states and Washington, D.C. found that for every slot of licensed childcare, there are more than five infants and toddlers, over three times the ratio when measuring preschool-aged children.8 Furthermore, 95% of counties studied were classified as childcare deserts, a deficit especially pronounced in rural and low-income areas. This absence of childcare forces parents out of the workforce, a burden falling largely upon mothers.9 Additionally, the earliest investments in children bear the highest returns, so inadvertently sacrificing the accessibility of childcare for that of preschool is likely to harm childrenâs success.10 Policy Idea To mitigate growing threats to already limited childcare accessibility, states implementing subsidization of preschool should utilize a mixed-delivery system that includes both private center-based and home-based care. Mixed- delivery systems enable state and federal funding to support preschool programs in various settings â public schools, center-based care, federally-funded means-tested Head Start preschool programs, religious centers, and, in some states, family or home-based childcare.11 Despite the fact that home-based care serves about three million children, only about half of states that implement mixed-delivery allow family childcare (FCC) providers to receive state funding.12 Home-based care is most utilized by rural families, families of marginalized racial groups, and low-income individuals who prioritize affordability, convenience, and flexible scheduling.2,13 It is also disproportionately provided by women of color.14 The FCC inclusive mixed-delivery funding structure subsidizes the care of private and FCC providers along with public pre-K facilities, helping them retain their preschool-aged children and remain economically viable. Policy Analysis The implementation of a mixed-delivery childcare system that includes FCC providers would facilitate family access to local, high-quality, culturally and linguistically responsive care, available even during non- traditional hours. Mixed-delivery has demonstrated to meet these goals. A report by the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation found that the stateâs mixed-delivery program successfully increased the accessibility of high-quality ECCE, particularly for low-income families.15
