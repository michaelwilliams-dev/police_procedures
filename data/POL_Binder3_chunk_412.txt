platform. Furthermore, recognizing that Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities are frequently disproportionately impacted by polypharmacy issues, the FPRI would work to guarantee that these communities have fair access to deprescribing resources and assistance, especially in areas where they are more likely to encounter obstacles to healthcare access.16 A decrease in the average number of drugs per patient, fewer adverse drug responses (tracked by hospitalization rates), and reduced healthcare costs, particularly those associated with Medicaid and Medicare, are the specific measures to gauge FPRIÕs performance. Furthermore, patientsÕ and caregiversÕ quarterly questionnaires will evaluate gains in quality of life and satisfaction with the deprescribing process. They will also track cost savings and hospitalization rate reductions yearly to assess the programÕs effectiveness. The FPRI will reduce the hazards of polypharmacy, improve life quality, and increase healthcare equality for Florida's senior citizens through this stepwise strategy, focused outreach, and established measurements.
