Purchases, replacement or replenishment items of first aid equipment must be ordered and managed using the normal requisitioning procedure through the Force Buying Co-ordinators. First Aid Rooms A suitable first aid room will be available where the assessment of first aid needs identifies this as necessary. It is also good practice to ensure a first aid room is identified for all new build projects within the Force.

The room should be exclusively used for first aid, occupational health provisions or breast feeding mothers. Refer to the Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations for guidance on examples of facilities and equipment which should be provided. In summary, to be effective the first aid room must:  Be equipped with a couch, desk, chair and telephone.  Be suitably lit and ventillated.  Contain a sink and hot and cold running water.  Contain soap and paper towels.  Contain a foot operated waste container.  Contain a store for first aid materials etc. Provision of information to Employees First aid notices will be clearly displayed in appropriate locations in all Wiltshire Police workplaces.
