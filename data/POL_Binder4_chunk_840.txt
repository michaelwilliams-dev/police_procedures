Responsibility for risk management The arresting or escorting officer should monitor the welfare of the detainee that they are responsible for until such time as they bring them before the custody officer. The custody officer is responsible for documenting and recording the risk assessment for every detainee in the custody record, in accordance with paragraphs 3.6 to 3.10 of PACE Code C. The custody officer must ensure that all those responsible for the detaineeâs custody are briefed about the risks. They should ensure their responses to risk are dynamic, reviewed and communicated to all people involved in the care of the detainee, including relevant healthcare staff.
