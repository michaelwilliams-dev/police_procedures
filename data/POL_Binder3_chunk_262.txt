a disclosure order 241. In addition to the general provisions on taking records, the appropriate officer should also keep copies of notices in writing issued under a disclosure order (see section 357(4)) together with full details of their issue and response. 242. The record of an interview should contain the following, as appropriate  a copy of the invitation to interview letter;  the date and place and time of the interview;  the time the interview began and ended, the time of any breaks in the interview and, subject to the provisions relating to pseudonyms of members of staff of the relevant Director, the names of all those present;  any request made for financial or legal advice, and action taken on that request;  that the person conducting the interview told the interviewee everything he was required to tell him or her under this code;  the name of person(s) excluded from the interview room, and the reason for that decision; and  the presence of an interpreter, and the reason for this.  243.
