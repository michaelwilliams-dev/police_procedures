Proactive Approach to Health and Wellbeing Health and Safety Executive Ð Management Standards The HSE Management Standards have been produced by the HSE to reduce the levels of work related stress reported by British workers. The Management Standards represent a set of conditions that reflect high levels of health, wellbeing and organisational performance. The Management Standards and supporting processes are designed to:  Help simplify risk assessment for work related stress.  Encourage employers, employees and their representatives to work in partnership to address work related stress throughout the organisation.  Provide the yardstick by which organizations can gauge their performance in tackling the key causes of stress.  The aim of the HSE Management Standards is to promote better mental health (less impact of stress) and increased productivity outcomes (i.e. decreased absenteeism and increased wellbeing and productivity) of employees. The Management Standards cover six key areas of work design that, if properly managed, are associated with improved health and wellbeing, higher productivity and improved attendance. The six Management Standards cover the primary sources of stress at work. These are:  Demands Ð includes issue like workload, work patterns and the work environment.  Control Ð how much say the person has in the way they work.  Support Ð includes the encouragement sponsorship and resources provided by the organisation, line management and colleagues.  Relationships Ð includes promoting positive working to avoid conflict and dealing with unacceptable behavior.  Role Ð whether people understand their role within the organisation and whether the organisation ensures that they do not have conflicting roles.  Change Ð how organisational change (large and small) is managed and communicated within the organisation. Please refer to Appendix 1 for full details of the standards. 6. Risk Assessment The Health and Safety Executive require all organisations
