at the date on which the child is placed for adoption (or enters Great Britain if the child is being adopted from overseas), the main responsibility, apart from the adopter, for the care of the child; and  complies with the relevant shared parental leave notice and evidence requirements. In addition, for the partner to be eligible for shared parental leave, the adopter must:  have been employed or been a self-employed earner during at least 26 of the 66 weeks immediately preceding the week in which the adopter is notified of having been matched for adoption with the child (or the week in which the child enters Great Britain in relation to an adoption from overseas);  have average weekly earnings of at least the maternity allowance threshold [currently £30] for any 13 of those 66 weeks;  have, at the date on which the child is placed for adoption (or enters Great Britain if the child is being adopted from overseas), the main responsibility, apart from the partner, for the care of the child;  be entitled to statutory adoption leave or statutory adoption pay in respect of the child; and  comply with the relevant adoption leave or pay curtailment requirements, or have returned to work before the end of statutory adoption leave. 7.25 Notice Requirements The notices that both of you must give to your employers in order to be able to take shared parental leave are made up of three elements.

The notice periods set out below are the minimum required by law. However, the earlier you inform the organisation of your intentions, the more likely it is that we will be able to accommodate your wishes, particularly if you want to take periods of discontinuous leave.

Similarly, the partner could provide your notice of entitlement and intention and period of leave notice at the same time. 7.26 Adopter's notice curtailing adoption leave Before the either of you can take shared parental leave, the adopter must either return to work before the end of their adoption leave (by giving the required eight weeks' notice of your planned return) or provide their
