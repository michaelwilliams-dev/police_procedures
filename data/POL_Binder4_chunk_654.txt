of that matter; it appears to that constable that that person is or may be incapable (whether or not he has purported to do so) of giving a valid consent to the taking of a specimen of blood; and it appears to that constable that that personâs incapacity is attributable to medical reasons. A request under this sectionâ shall not be made to a medical practitioner who for the time being has any responsibility (apart from the request) for the clinical care of the person concerned; and shall not be made to a medical practitioner other than a police medical practitioner unlessâ it is not reasonably practicable for the request to made to a police medical practitioner; or it is not reasonably practicable for such a medical practitioner (assuming him to be willing to do so) to take the specimen. It shall be lawful for a medical practitioner to whom a request is made under this section, if he thinks fitâ to take a specimen of blood from the person concerned irrespective of whether that person consents; and to provide the sample to a constable. If a specimen is taken in pursuance of a request under this section, the specimen shall not be subjected to a laboratory test unless the person from whom it was takenâ has been informed that it was taken; and has been required by a constable to give his permission for a laboratory test of the specimen; and has given his permission. A constable must, on requiring a person to give his permission for the purposes of this section for a laboratory test of a specimen, warn that person that a failure to give the permission may render him liable to prosecution. A person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to give his permission for a laboratory test of a specimen of blood taken from him under this section is guilty of an offence.
