areas, like the Interstate-90 corridor. CDFIs can work quickly in giving this boost, as typically smaller, struggling organizations now face fewer barriers to entry from CDFIs, whose jobs are intrinsically to save failing businesses.15 As such, a legislator- created policy to provide greater funding to CDFIs primarily providing their services to I-90 corridor businesses is required. Highlights  In 2023, the Interstate-90 corridor, a key trade and transportation route spanning New York State, was selected as a national technology hub under the federal CHIPS and Science Act.1,2  Business growth in the I-90 corridor remains stagnant, hindered by insufficient government support that can diminish the impact of the CHIPS Act.3,4  New York should fund and deepen access to Community Development Financial Institutions by providing them with lump- sum grants carved from the state budget.7  CDFIs target smaller businesses that serve underserved populations, revitalizing struggling businesses and areas.9 Implementation The CDFI grant program will be application-based, requiring Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to prove how they plan to support new economic development and outline a detailed funding roadmap. This approach builds on the successful model of New YorkÕs Small Business Seed Funding Grant Program (BSFG Program), which operated similarly.16 Both programs rely on an application-based system administered by the state, require the signature of the Governor to pursue their directives and give lump-sum funding to businesses in need. Grant sizes will vary based on each CDFIÕs previous gross payouts, ensuring larger institutions receive funding proportionate to their needs while smaller CDFIs obtain adequate resources to expand operations. This tiered structure avoids a one-size-fits-all approach, empowering institutions of all sizes. Again, previous programs like the BSFG have operated exactly like this, proving the feasibility and giving a model for this programÕs success.17 Some business owners in upstate New York may be concerned about prioritizing CDFIs over other lending institutions. CDFIs often require additional steps to demonstrate community impact, like maintaining community partnerships and may be less accessible to business owners outside underserved areas.18 However, it is important to then articulate the primary reason for these grants: to grow small business operations, bring economic growth to underperforming areas, and help marginalized communities become more economically mobile. Past precedent proves that CDFIs are effective at reaching targeted demographics: while traditional banks often exclude marginalized communities because of ingrained mistrust, high collateral expectations, and inconvenient geography, CDFI recipients are 60% people of color, 50% women, and 28% rural residents.19,20 As such, CDFIs can provide for the most diversified overall growth, which is essential to revitalize an area in need of economic growth injections. With CDFIs being a potential savior for underserved New York communities, it is important to utilize strict CDFI regulations that ensure the safety and efficacy of these institutions. The Department of Treasury outlines steps that states like New York can take to monitor their CDFIs, including expressed punishments for violations in the CDFI application, listed illegal and inconsistent practices and clearly expressed ways that CDFIs must contribute to community-level goals.21
