students with diverse needs in various environments.1 SETs are essential in providing personalized instruction to students with diverse learning needs, ensuring they receive the tailored education necessary for success.2 In 2023 through 2024, more than 80% of states reported a shortage of SETs, and the number of students needing special education has risen due to improved identification and a deeper understanding of how to support those with learning differences.3 This shortage significantly affects the quality of education for students with learning differences, leading to larger class sizes, less individualized attention, and increased burnout among existing teachers.4 In 49 states, up to 50% of special education teachers face burnout within five years, and an alarming 75% leave the profession entirely within ten years.5 Teacher burnout occurs when educators undergoing stress for a long period experience emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and lack of personal accomplishment.6 When looking at laws pertaining to special education, The U.S. Department of Educationâs Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a law that provides children with disabilities nationwide access to free public education, including special education.7 The IDEA oversees how states and public agencies deliver early intervention, special education, and related services to over 7.3 million eligible infants, children, and youth with disabilities.7 Besides this, Congress has yet to successfully introduce, pass, and send a comprehensive bill addressing the need to alleviate the shortage of SETs. Policy Idea The IDEA authorizes discretionary grants, providing states with the flexibility to allocate funding toward novel solutions that directly address the challenges faced by SETs. These grants offer a critical opportunity to develop targeted programs that can have a lasting impact on teacher burnout, job satisfaction, and retention rates. Congress should mandate individual states to use their IDEA-authorized grants to create programs that teach SETs Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a promising practice for solving teacher burnout, and ensuring each SET has the administrative support needed to maintain the level of materials and resources needed to educate their students.8 By strategically utilizing discretionary grants, states can provide immediate relief to SETs while also creating a sustainable foundation for SETs to thrive long term. Moreover, the discretionary nature of these grants allows states to tailor solutions to their specific needs, taking into account factors like student population, regional differences, and current resources. Policy Analysis As the student population grows, policymakers often focus on the supply shortage of special education teachers.3 However, it is more important to first implement policies that help retain current teachers in the field before focusing on recruiting new ones. By directing public agencies to use discretionary grants for new programs, challenges with job retention, satisfaction, and burnout can become much more manageable. When considering teacher burnout, research has shown that burnout in special education stems from difficult student behaviors, insufficient support from administration, and overwhelming job responsibilities.9 The overarching goal of ACT is to emphasize staying in the present moment while simultaneously encouraging psychological flexibility that is in line with oneâs values and goals.
