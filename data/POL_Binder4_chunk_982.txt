programmes; Investigate the history of the relationship (as well as the perpetratorâs history with other victims) and recognise the dynamics including any power imbalance; Where substance misuse has occurred, be alert to the more complex dynamics that might exist meaning the abuse is not necessarily âalcohol-related violenceâ and that the violence may be symptomatic of domestic abuse;184 Record any crimes and any previous incidents and place a domestic abuse flag on them, following National Crime Recording Standards. Consider that behaviours such as harassment and stalking may from part of the abuse but be recorded as separate offences; Consider whether an application under the âRight to Knowâ route of the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, also known as âClareâs Lawâ, needs to be made; Provide the victim with accessible information about the criminal justice process and their rights under the Victimsâ Code; Be aware that perpetrators may raise counter or cross-allegations when reported by victims of abuse, and care should be taken to assess evidence and correctly identify victims and perpetrators, which can include family members.185 184 See, for example, Ward, M, et al.

Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance In the event that a victim of abuse is reported as being a perpetrator by the real perpetrator, it is important that the victim should still be given support as a victim.

This could be a supportive friend or family member (who is not a potential witness); this person should not be the child of the victim or perpetrator or any individual or member of the community where there is risk that they may disclose information shared by the victim with the perpetrator; and Consider and follow your forceâs positive action policy. Link between victimisation and offending Police and other criminal justice agencies should recognise the part domestic abuse can play in offending behaviour; this link is highlighted in the Ministry of Justiceâs Female Offender Strategy. The response from criminal justice agencies to those affected can be pivotal in identifying domestic abuse at the earliest opportunity, offering support, and helping to break the cycle of victimisation and offending. A range of offences may result from a victimâs experience of abuse, including: handling stolen goods under threat of violence from a partner; possession of a controlled substance belonging to an abusive partner; use of force against an abusive partner or ex-partner; failure to ensure school attendance for fear of meeting an abusive partner or ex-partner.188 Agencies should always consider the possible context of domestic abuse in female offending
