A court shall not suspend the prohibition imposed on any person by a travel restriction order for any period unless it is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, in that personâs case, that justify the suspension on compassionate grounds of that prohibition for that period. In making any determination on an application for the suspension of the prohibition imposed on any person by a travel restriction order, a court (in addition to considering the matters mentioned in subsection (3)) shall have regard toâ that personâs character; his conduct since the making of the order; the offences of which he was convicted on the occasion on which the order was made; and any other circumstances of the case that the court considers relevant. Where the prohibition imposed on any person by a travel restriction order is suspended, it shall be the duty of that personâ to be in the United Kingdom when the period of the suspension ends; and if the order contains a direction under section 33(4), to surrender, before the end of that period, any [F85passport] returned or issued to that person, in respect of the suspension, by the Secretary of State; and a [F85passport] that is required to be surrendered under paragraph (b) shall be surrendered to the Secretary of State in such manner or by being sent to such address as the Secretary of State may direct at the time when he returns or issues it.
