discusses implications and potentialities of anthropologically thinking and researching with documents, arguing that they consist of ethnographic artifacts, which can be particularly fruitful in certain research contexts. In order to do that, it resumes some movements of distancing and rapprochement between anthropology and docu- ments and places two recent ethnographic experiences in dialogue. One a research through police inquiries of Brazilian Federal Police concerning "human trafficking for sexual exploitation" crimes, and the other focused on ad- ministrative procedures related to "missing persons" cases investigated by Rio de Janeiro Civil Police. In addition to revealing the heuristic potential of "following the paper" and calling attention to the micro politics of the interac- tions among those that document and those who are documented, the paper aims to contribute to larger discus- sions about the challenges that dealing with documents in field work situations poses to anthropology and its self- representations. Keywords: documents, ethnographic artifacts, Federal Police, Civil Police, human trafficking, missing persons RESUMO O artigo discute implicaes e potencialidades analticas de se pensar e pesquisar antropologicamente com docu- mentos, argumentando que estes constituem artefatos etnogrficos especialmente rentveis em certos contextos de pesquisa. Para tanto, recupera alguns movimentos de distanciamento e aproximao entre a antropologia e os documentos e coloca em dilogo duas experincias etnogrficas recentes: uma pesquisa em meio a inquritos da Polcia Federal brasileira relativos a crimes de "trfico de pessoas para fim de explorao sexual", e outra voltada para procedimentos administrativos em torno de casos de "desaparecimento de pessoa" investigados pela Polcia Civil do Rio de Janeiro. Alm de revelar o potencial heurstico da escolha por "seguir o papel" e chamar ateno para a micropoltica das interaes entre documentadores e documentados, o texto busca contribuir para reflexes mais amplas acerca dos desafios que a lida com documentos em situaes de trabalho de campo aporta  antropologia e s suas autorrepresentaes. Palavras-chave: documentos, artefatos etnogrficos, Polcia Federal, Polcia Civil, trfico de pessoas, desapareci- mento de pessoas Recent anthropological research dealing with documents has contributed to fundamental debates on classic con- ceptions of both ethnographic practice and ethnographic authority. This article seeks to discuss some theoretical and methodological dilemmas, implications and potentialities of anthropological thinking and researching with documents. In order to do that, it resumes some movements of distancing and rapprochement between anthropol- ogy and documents, and places two ethnographic experiences in dialogue. It departs from the assumption that one of the tasks that anthropology systematically faces is to rethink both the construction of its objects, and the selec- tion of the artifacts from which ethnographies are built. The "post-modern" view of ethnography as text has led anthropologists to turn their attention to other textual gen- res that had either been set aside or regarded as less important once anthropology moved away from the "arm- chair" and gained "scientific" authority and legitimacy through malinowskian fieldwork. On the one hand, "archives" came to be viewed as privileged spaces for understanding relationships between colonial governments and peo- ples traditionally studied by anthropologists (Stoler,
