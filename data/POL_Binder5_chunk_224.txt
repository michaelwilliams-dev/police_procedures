or a place, or on any person there, which they suspect of being connected with an offence, or a possible offence under the Act (other than an offence under section 22(3) of the 1968 Act or connected with air weapons) or, in connection with a firearm, imitation firearm or ammunition, there is a danger to the public safety or to the peace. 22.4 The power to seize and detain under section 46 of the 1968 Act includes a power to require information stored in any electronic form, which is accessible from the premises or place in question, to be produced in a legible and visible form which can be taken away. Stop and search 22.5 Section 47 of the 1968 Act gives the police various powers in connection with offences and suspected offences in a public place, or elsewhere, under sections 18(1) and (2) and 20 of the 1968 Act. A constable having reasonable cause to suspect a person of having a firearm, with or without ammunition, with them in a public place, or to be committing or about to commit, elsewhere than in a public place, offences under sections 18(1) and (2) and 20 may require the firearms or ammunition to be handed over for examination, search that person and detain them for the purpose of doing so, and, if a vehicle is involved, search the vehicle 181 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law and for that purpose require the person driving or in control of it to stop it. For the purpose of exercising these powers a constable may enter any place. 22.6 The primary purpose of section 47(1) of the 1968 Act is to enable a constable to require the handing over of a firearm and any ammunition for their examination so that they may ascertain, for instance, whether a firearm is real or an imitation, what type of firearm it is (if this is not apparent), whether it is loaded or whether the ammunition is suitable for use in the firearm. It is, for example, an offence under section 19 of the 1968 Act, as amended by section 37(1) of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, to have with you in a public place, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse: i) a loaded shot gun, ii) an air weapon (whether loaded or not), iii) any other firearm (whether loaded or not) together with ammunition suitable for use in that firearm, or iv) an imitation firearm in a public place. 22.7 Thus if a constable sees a person with such a gun in a public place, although they have obvious grounds for suspecting them of having a firearm, they may well have no grounds for suspecting an offence until they have exercised the powers given by section 47(1) of the 1968 Act and examined the firearm. If the person refuses to hand over a firearm or ammunition when required to do so, they commit an offence and a power of arrest arises, as explained below. 22.8 The powers to
