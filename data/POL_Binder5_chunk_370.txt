with normal or corrected vision throughout its product life expectancy (plus two years). Manufacturers should assess the longevity of labels prior to production. If labels degrade and become unreadable in service, they shall be replaced immediately at the cost of the manufacturer. It is the responsibility of the end-user to ensure the product continues to meet these requirements. 3.5. Certification process Figure 2 outlines the key elements involved in the submission of armour for testing in order to achieve certification to this standard. Any testing completed outside of this process will be considered as development testing only and results will not be accepted as part of the certification process. Figure 2: Process map for certification to the 2017 Home Office Body Armour Standard 3.6. Declaration of construction For each model of armour, a completed declaration of construction (Appendix A), shall be submitted via email to declarations@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk. This shall be supported by both a comprehensive technical file and redacted technical file. The subject of the email shall follow the naming convention: [Manufacturer] Ð [Armour Model Unique Identifier] Ð [Protection Level] Ð [Chosen Test Facility].6 3.6.1.
