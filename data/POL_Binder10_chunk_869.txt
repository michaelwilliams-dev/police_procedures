Positive action in the period immediately after the report of a crime minimises the amount of material that could be lost to the investigation and maximises the chance of securing the material that will be admissible in court.

It is important that the customer is not asked to redial 999 to ask for a specific area as this goes against procedure and BT operators will override the request and connect to the Emergency Authority (EA) with the presented routing information. It is the responsibility of the 999 operator to establish that the call is proper to the Force area and to instigate means of transfer if it is not. This can be achieved in several different ways in decreasing order of preference. i. Taking details of the call and passing the information to the correct Force Control Room; If option (i) is not possible, then ii. Recalling the BT operator and requesting that the call is passed to another EA or County. This may not be possible if the BT Operator has already relinquished the call into the system. The 999 Operator should not advise the caller to redial 999 and request a specific area or Police Force. The BT Operator will automatically connect the call to the relevant Force as per the presented routing information and override the request from the caller. If a call has been misrouted the 999 Operator should advise the CHA by completing a misroute form and sending to 999liaison@bt.com .
