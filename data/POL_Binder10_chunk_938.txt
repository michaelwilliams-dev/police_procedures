Introduction The misuse of alcohol and drugs can lead to reduced efficiency, increased risk of accidents, increased sickness absence and potential misconduct. This can have serious consequences for staff, their families, friends and colleagues and the wider police service. This policy and procedure applies to all police officers and staff irrespective of rank, grade or role, employed by or working under the authority of Wiltshire Police including;  Temporary staff and trainees  Persons seconded from other forces  Members of the Special Constabulary  Any Volunteer or Contractor acting in the interest of Wiltshire Police  Colleagues within the OPCC 2. Policy Statement Wiltshire Police is committed to:  Providing a working environment that gives consideration to the health, welfare and well-being of all individuals working within it.  Providing a confidential environment in which individuals can raise concerns they may have. Confidentiality in principle shall be in place, unless by maintaining confidentiality, it puts the individual themselves, other colleagues or member of the public at risk.  Providing a customer focused service to everyone in Wiltshire. This is supported by a robust and transparent approach to the Force Values and professional standards issues. Wiltshire Police does not approve of the excessive or inappropriate use of alcohol or the misuse of alcohol or the misuse of drugs, whether illegal or legal. Possessing and supplying illegal drugs are criminal offences. However, help will be offered to those who volunteer that they may have a substance misuse or alcohol misuse problem. All individuals are encouraged to volunteer that they have a substance misuse or alcohol misuse problem. This policy is aligned with that published by the National Police Chiefs Council (formerly Association of Chief Police Officers). This policy is in keeping with the force values and behaviours and wellbeing strategy. 3.
