practitioners to maximise the positive impact of any local mentoring provision, and minimise the likelihood of ineffective or unintentionally harmful practice. Bullying prevention Anti-bullying programmes (for example, the Olweus Bullying Prevention Programme and KiVa10) can reduce reported victimisation * There are many elements of different anti- bullying programmes that are seen as effective, and strategies such as proactive peer support and reactive anti-bullying school-based strategies have been rated as moderately effective by practitioners. * The most successful programmes include: involving parents; using disciplinary methods; and high duration and intensity programmes. * However, some types of peer involvement (peer mediation, peer mentoring or peer group pressure as bystanders) as part of an anti- bullying programme may actually increase victimisation.11 Improving social skills Improving social skills can strengthen school attachment and raise achievement, and can also reduce anti-social/ aggressive behaviour and prevent future violence * Social development programmes can involve managing anger, modifying behaviour, adopting a social perspective, moral development, building social skills, solving social problems, and resolving conflicts.12 Examples include the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) programme13 and the Second Steps programme14, which promote emotional development, self- regulation, and social problem-solving skills. * Targeted social skills training (such as Participate and Learn Skills) involves helping children to use their time constructively, increasing self-esteem and providing positive role models.15 * Other examples of social skills programmes with evidence of effectiveness include the ÔGood Behaviour GameÕ,16 the ÔAnne FrankÕ programme,17 ÔItÕs not OK!Õ18 and the SEAL curriculum materials.19 Involving parents Programmes that work with both parents and young people have been shown to be successful in reducing behavioural problems and preventing violence Examples include: * HomeÐschool partnership programmes that promote parental involvement in their childrenÕs education; * Multi-systemic therapy, an intensive therapy- based programme provided in the home that works with children and parents to increase young peopleÕs engagement in education or training;20 * Parenting programmes that try to enable carers to fulfil their role effectively (effective for younger children, 3Ð12 years).21 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) Well-administered CBT (for example, anger- coping skills training, problem-solving skills training) has been shown to be effective in addressing aggression and conduct disorders in pre-adolescents * CBT aims to change the way that young people think and act around a particular issue, and typically involves a range of procedures and exercises in individual or group sessions. It sometimes also involves the family or school in therapy. * CBT programmes should be organised with the help of a trained professional.22 Approaches with more limited evidence of effectiveness Knife arches/ knife wands * The evidence is unclear on whether routinely searching students for weapons on their entry into school, for example, by installing knife arches or using knife wands, has an impact on levels of violence.23 * However, making Ôsafe spacesÕ (that is building an educational environment that young people feel is well monitored/ controlled, with harassment and victimisation actively prevented) in general may be one way to address violence in educational establishments. * Safe school environments can improve
