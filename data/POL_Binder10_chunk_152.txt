and more complex premises, it is best to keep a dedicated record of all maintenance of fire-protection equipment and training. There is no one ÔcorrectÕ format specified for this. Suitable record books are available from trade associations and may also be available from your local enforcing authority. In all cases the quality of records may also be regarded as a good indicator of the overall quality of the safety management structure. Your records should be kept in a specified place on the premises (for example, in the managementÕs office), and should include:  details of any significant findings from the fire risk assessment and any action taken (see Part 1, Section 4.1);  testing and checking of escape routes, including final exit locking mechanisms, such as panic devices, emergency exit devices and any electromagnetic devices;  testing of fire-warning systems, including weekly alarm tests and periodic maintenance by a competent person;  recording of false alarms;  testing and maintenance of emergency lighting systems;  testing and maintenance of fire extinguishers, hose reels and fire blankets etc.;  if appropriate, testing and maintenance of other fire safety equipment such as fire-suppression systems and smoke control systems;  recording and training of relevant people and fire evacuation drills;  planning, organising, policy and implementation, monitoring, audit and review;  maintenance and audit of any systems that are provided to help the fire and rescue service;  the arrangements in a large multi-occupied building for a co-ordinated emergency plan or overall control of the actions you or your staff should take if there is a fire; and  all alterations, tests, repairs and maintenance of fire safety systems, including passive systems such as fire doors. Other issues that you may wish to record include:  the competence, qualifications and status of the persons responsible for carrying out inspections and tests;  the results of periodic safety audits, reviews, inspections and tests, and any remedial action taken;  all incidents and circumstances which had the potential to cause accidents and monitor subsequent remedial actions; and  a record of the building use, the fire prevention and protection measures in place and high-risk areas. You should ensure that no other management decisions or policies compromise safety. Your documentation should be available for inspection by representatives of the enforcing authority.
