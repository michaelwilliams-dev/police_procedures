and the behaviour has a serious effect on the victim. This means that the behaviour causes the victim to fear violence will be used against them on two or more occasions, or it has a substantial adverse effect on the victimâs usual day to day activities and the perpetrator knows, or ought to know, that it will have a serious effect on the victim. 34 ONS. Domestic abuse prevalence and victim characteristics - Office for National Statistics (ons.gov.uk): Data year ending March 2020. 35 Economic abuse can be prosecuted under the offence of controlling or coercive behaviour in section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015 (âthe 2015 Actâ). As defined in the 2015 Act, the offence of controlling or coercive behaviour states that: An offence is committed by âAâ if: A repeatedly or continuously engages in behaviour towards another person, âBâ, that is controlling or coercive; At the time of the behaviour, A and B are âpersonally connectedâ; The behaviour has a serious effect on B; and A knows or ought to know that the behaviour will have a serious effect on B. Once in force, section 68 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 will amend the definition of âpersonally connectedââ in section 76 of the 2015 Act to remove the âliving togetherââ requirement, which means that the offence of controlling or coercive behaviour will apply to partners, ex-partners or family members, regardless of whether the victim and perpetrator live together. 36 See Adams, AE, Sullivan, CM, Bybee, D, Greeson, MR.
