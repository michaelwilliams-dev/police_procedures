commonly pressure victims to reconcile instead of pursuing legal action. 4,5,6 This lack of enforcement leaves victims vulnerable and without proper legal recourse. In rural areas, cultural stigma and a strong emphasis on family unity deter women from approaching law enforcement, which limits forensic evidence collection and prevents many cases from reaching court.7 Sexual violence crimes are often only prosecuted when physical injuries or biological evidence are present, reflecting a narrow interpretation of ÒviolenceÓ in Kyrgyz law that excludes psychological or economic harm.8 Consequently, many forms of abuse remain unaddressed. Moreover, the legal term ÒhelplessnessÓ in cases of sexual assault lacks a clear definition, leaving victims without legal recourse if they cannot physically resist. Approximately 86% of domestic violence cases are retracted, often due to police inaction, financial dependency, and a lack of shelterÑfactors that leave victims with few options but to return to unsafe situations.9 Alarmingly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported a 20% increase in domestic violence cases in 2023 compared to the previous year, while the number of domestic violence victims increased by 5.1 times from 2010 to 2021.10,11 Women in rural areas are most affected due to the legal and cultural barriers. Children also suffer under this system, with 104 cases of child violence documented in 2021, many of which were prematurely closed.12 Current policies, such as the Law on Domestic Violence, still have weak law enforcement that fails to provide adequate protection through restraining orders and prioritizes reconciliation.13 Policy Idea To improve law enforcement's response to domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan, the government should implement a mandatory, ongoing specialized training program that includes the following: 1. Mandatory training for all law enforcement officers on domestic violence, focusing on recognizing psychological and economic abuse as well as physical violence.14 2. Regular refresher courses are held annually to ensure officers stay up to date on best practices and are fully equipped to handle domestic violence cases effectively.15 3. Comprehensive curriculum covering the enforcement of restraining orders and prioritizing victim safety over reconciliation, emphasizing rural areas where enforcement is weakest.16 4. Accountability mechanisms to assess officersÕ performance and ensure compliance with the training, including routine evaluations.17 5. Collaboration with local and international organizations, such as UN Women and Bir Duino (a human rights organization protecting civil liberties and advocating for marginalized groups) to provide resources and support for the training program.18 Policy Analysis The implementation of mandatory, ongoing specialized training for police officers in Kyrgyzstan would enhance law enforcement's ability to respond to domestic and sexual violence cases. A study by the Australian Institute of Criminology demonstrates that training focused on recognizing coercive control (a pattern of controlling behaviors that create an unequal power dynamic), psychological abuse, and economic violence has led to more effective handling of cases, resulting in higher arrest rates and better enforcement of restraining orders.19 Additionally, such training enhances officers' ability to identify the primary aggressor in complex domestic violence situations, helping to reduce repeat offenses and prevent further harm.19 Practical, scenario-based training, including mock
