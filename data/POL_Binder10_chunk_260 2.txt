Published January 2021 Collection Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard Hub The CDDO and RTA are helping public sector organisations provide clear information about algorithmic tools they use to support decisions. From: Government Digital Service (/government/organisations/government-digital- service), Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology) and Central Digital and Data Office (/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-offic Published 5 January 2023 Last updated 17 December 2024 Ñ The Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard helps public sector organisations provide clear information about the algorithmic tools they use, and why theyÕre using them. Algorithmic transparency means being open about how algorithmic tools support decisions. This includes providing information on algorithmic tools and algorithm- assisted decisions in a complete, open, understandable, easily-accessible, and free format. The Hub is made up of: The Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard and template for completing a record (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/algorithmic- transparency-template) Guidance on using and completing algorithmic transparency records (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for- org anisations-using-the-algorithmic-transparency-recording- standard) A repository of published transparency records (https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records) Scope and exemptions policy for mandatory use of the Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/algorithmic- transparency-recording-standard-mandatory-scope-and- exemptions-policy) The Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard is part of the governmentÕs National Data Strategy. The strategy has a commitment to explore an appropriate and effective way to deliver greater transparency on algorithm-assisted decision making in the public sector. The National AI Strategy reiterated this commitment, with an action to conduct research that will help develop a cross- government standard for algorithmic transparency. In the AI white paper consultation response (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ai-regulation-a- pro-innovation-approach-policy-proposals/outcome/a-pro- innovation-approach-to-ai-regulation-g overnment-response) published in February 2024, we announced that use of the ATRS will become a requirement for all central government departments, with an intent to extend this to the broader public sector over time. The Central Digital and Data Office (https://www.gov.uk/government/org anisations/central-digital- and-data-office) (CDDO) and Responsible Technology Adoption Unit (RTA) developed the Standard collaboratively by working with civil society groups and external experts. ItÕs also informed by a public engagement study (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cdei-publishes- commissioned-research-on-algorithmic-transparency-in-the- public-sector) run by the RTA and Britain Thinks. The Standard has been piloted with a variety of public sector organisations across the UK and the published pilot records are available on our report collection page (https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records). Following the pilots, the Standard was updated to reflect feedback, and we plan to review it every 6 months.
