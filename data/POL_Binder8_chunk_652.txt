The consultation sought views on whether to introduce new statutory measures focused on reporting and acting on child abuse and neglect, in addition to our ongoing programme of wide-ranging reforms. 5. The headline question in the consultation asked which of the following three options was most preferable:  allowing the package of reform measures focused on improving how the whole system responds to child abuse and neglect to be implemented before considering the introduction of additional statutory measures;  the introduction of a duty to act, focused on taking appropriate action in relation to child abuse and neglect, with sanctions for deliberate and reckless failures; or  the introduction of a mandatory reporting duty focused on increasing the reporting of child abuse and neglect. 6.

The consultation opened on 21 July 2016 and closed on 13 October 2016, receiving 768 responses. In addition, the Government held a roundtable meeting chaired by the then Minister for Vulnerability, Safeguarding and Countering Extremism.
