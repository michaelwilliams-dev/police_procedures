structure, backlash from fiscal conservatives over high federal costs may arise. A study by AARP and the Retirement Research Center projected that 58% of workers with access to a similar model of universal auto-IRA would have saved more than $100,000 for retirement, compared to only 9% of those without access. Meanwhile, 75% of workers without a payroll deduction program have saved less than $10,000.12 Policymakers should emphasize such long-term savings from reduced reliance on government assistance during retirement, presenting data that shows how automatic IRAs can decrease dependency on federal welfare programs. Additionally, a phased rollout and capped initial incentives for employers could help address cost concerns while appealing to budget-conscious stakeholders. For implementation, careful coordination must be made with the U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS, which play critical roles in overseeing the policyâs rollout. Upon enactment, the Treasury would develop the programâs financial infrastructure by establishing secure and accessible platforms for account management and investment options, allowing employees to track their savings and manage accounts easily. To reduce administrative obstacles, especially for small businesses, the Treasury would unify processes like contributions and reporting into a streamlined, user-friendly system, simplifying participation and compliance. Meanwhile, the IRS would manage compliance, enrollment, and tax-related oversight. This would include ensuring payroll deductions are implemented correctly and contributions are accurately reported. The IRS could also provide clear guidelines, digital resources, and support materials to help employers transition smoothly, as well as a dedicated support line to address questions, making the policy accessible and reducing administrative burden.
