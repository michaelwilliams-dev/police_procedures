American militaries accountable. On November 3rd, 1991, Peruvian military officials killed 15 people in the Barrios Alto neighborhood on false suspicions of terrorism.6 Later, the Peruvian Congress adopted an amnesty law that exonerated army members who committed human rights violations between 1980 and 1995.6 In 2001, the IACHR ruled that Peruâs law violated the American Convention on Human Rights.6 Following the ruling, Peru created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR) to monitor human rights violations, and in 2005, the CVR formalized the Comprehensive Reparations Plan which compensates individuals who were subjects of human rights violations.7 Given Mexicoâs ongoing inability to hold its National Guard accountable, oversight from the IACHR is a logical approach to convince Sheinbaum to implement more accountability reforms. Highlights Mexico has struggled to balance militarizing its National Guard and addressing the Organization of American Statesâ Inter- American Commission on Human Rightsâ concerns over human rights abuses in the military. Mexican senators and deputies who are not members of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaumâs Sigamos Haciendo Historia political alliance should lobby the President to implement IACHRâs reforms to hold the National Guard accountable. Mexico has successfully implemented some IACHR reforms relating to human rights in the past, such as the National Law on the Use of Force, which Mexico has consistently been adhering to since its implementation in 2019. IACHRâs involvement in the Barrios Alto case in Peru, which saw Peru create the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to monitor human rights violations in 2001 after military officials killed 15 people on false suspicions of terrorism in 1991, demonstrates its ability to hold Latin American military officials accountable to human rights. Implementation Implementing reforms to the National Guard will require deputies from different parties not affiliated with Sigamos Haciendo Historia, such as VÃ­ctor Manuel PÃ©rez DÃ­az of the National Action Party and Laura HernÃ¡ndez GarcÃ­a of the Citizensâ Movement, to begin lobbying support in Mexicoâs lower house. During the September general Chamber of Deputies session that put the National Guard under military oversight, PÃ©rez DÃ­az voiced his opinion against the reform, citing that when the military assumes civilian functions, they violate rights and increase repression.8 Much like PÃ©rez DÃ­az, HernÃ¡ndez GarcÃ­a stated that in regards to the National Guard, the Mexican government neither has the capacity nor will to create a civil authority with the ability to address Mexicoâs security problems Although the militarization reform did pass, PÃ©rez DÃ­az and HernÃ¡ndez GarcÃ­a can mobilize their respective parties to push for accountability reforms, such as those that IACHR has recommended, in a completely new multipartisan effort to increase the likelihood of building future support for reforms when Sheinbaumâs term is up in 2030. Having deputies from multiple parties lobbying for accountability reforms is the first step to making the National Guard accountable. Building on the Chamber of Deputiesâ work, Mexicoâs senators also not aligned with Sigamos Haciendo Historia, such as Senator Cristina RuÃ­z Sandoval of Mexicoâs Institutional Revolutionary Party, should pressure Sheinbaum directly to implement accountability measures. Like her deputy counterparts,
