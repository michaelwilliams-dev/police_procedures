forensic investigation, policing, or criminology.34 These efforts,, alongside creating new exchange initiatives, can help cultivate a cohort of professionally educated officers. Strong enforcement mechanisms will hold police officers accountable and reinforce the culture shift. Civilian oversight boards (COBs) at the tehsil, or county, level should have independent review powers, full- time staff, investigative access, and the authority to issue punishments. To ensure impartiality and avoid the perception of bias or corruption, COB members should be elected locally and prohibited from having close family ties to law enforcement or political parties. Investigative and sanctioning authority is essential for accurate case reviews and appropriate punishments. To prevent challenges to COB authority, police leadership should face administrative or criminal consequences for failing to comply with COB decisions and respect their investigative authority. Additionally, COB positions should offer competitive wages relative to local income to reduce the risk of bribery.35 Lastly, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) should create a database that tracks all police officers and members of the Civil Armed Forces, a paramilitary internal security force. The FIA would require regular reports on police complaints investigated by COBs and resulting punishments. This data should be published annually and made publicly available. While a similar application exists for government services, a dedicated system for the police force is needed. Stakeholders must prioritize local changes since enforcement of the Police Order 2002 at the federal level has been anemic. Organizing citizens at the district and provincial levels through NGOs like the Human Rights Council and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan can pressure local leaders and circumvent national political challenges. Efforts should focus on regions with the greatest potential for success and support, such as Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where reform efforts have made progress despite challenges and setbacks.36,37,38 Collecting data from these areas will help demonstrate the effectiveness of the programs, motivating change in other regions and gradually improving police professionalism and broader institutional reform at the nationally.
