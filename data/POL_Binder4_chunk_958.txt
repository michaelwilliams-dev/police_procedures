When considering the needs of children affected by domestic abuse, schools and colleges may also want to consider their duties in regard to children with special educational needs, including those with behavioural problems, and refer to the SEND Code of Practice. There is also guidance available on child-on-child sexual violence and sexual harassment in schools and colleges in England.
