individuals are homeowners.3 Minority groups consistently face lower homeownership rates compared to their White counterparts, and homes owned by minority groups tend to have lower appraisal values.3 These disparities are rooted in a long history of racial discrimination in the housing market, dating back to the early 20th century when exclusionary behavior such as redlining was commonplace.4 Municipalities across the country must address this via public policy to ensure a more equitable housing market going forward. Shared appreciation mortgages can make homeownership more accessible to those who need it the most. Policy Idea Local governments across the United States should leverage both federal and state funds to establish shared appreciation mortgage programs. It is ideal for local governments to tackle this issue, as there tends to be extensive variation in housing policies by state and locality. Shared appreciation mortgages, or loans, are typically structured as deferred loans.5 They are interest-free, with repayment deferred until the property is either sold or refinanced, at which the loan is repaid.5 This differs from a typical mortgage, which is repaid in monthly payments. Furthermore, the homeowner pays a percentage of any property value appreciation gained over time.5 If a home depreciates, the buyer only repays the value of the loan, without interest.6 These programs allow for increased housing accessibility by lowering upfront costs for buyers, while also allowing lenders to recapture new property value gained over time. By financing mortgages with a combination of equity and debt, shared appreciation mortgages spread risk more evenly across lenders and borrowers, decreasing the risk of foreclosure if home prices fall.5 Policy Analysis A 2019 study from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University used data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to estimate the number of eligible households for shared appreciation mortgages across the country. The analysis found that 6.6 million potential homeowners could buy a home in their county with $25,000 to $100,000 in financial assistance, which the authors noted was typical of most shared appreciation programs.6The study also found that an additional 8.6 million people could buy a home with financial assistance of $100,000 or more.6 Furthermore, the study found that shared appreciation programs could ease racial disparities in homeownership.6 The study found that if all 1.4 million potential Black homeowners became homeowners through shared appreciation programs in 2013, their homeownership rate wouldÕve increased by 10%.6 Moreover, if all potential Hispanic homeowners became homeowners through shared appreciation mortgages in 2013, their homeownership rate would have increased by 9.4%.6 A 2018 study in the Housing Policy Debate journal observed the short-term loan performance of homeowners participating in nine shared appreciation mortgage programs.7 Using a difference-in- difference analysis, the study compared the outcomes of shared appreciation mortgage holders with the outcomes of other first-time homebuyers in metropolitan areas.7 The results showed that shared appreciation mortgage purchasers had Òsignificantly less mortgage debtÓ and were Òless likely to have a home equity line of credit.Ó7 Furthermore, the study observed no significant difference between shared
