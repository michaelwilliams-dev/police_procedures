information on the address is correctly formatted before searching in Niche  Some house numbers may be found in the premises or flat field instead of the house number field. Additional searches using just the postcode or street name may be required  Businesses and motorway marker posts can be found in either the premises name or the common name. Always check both  If a new business moves into a premises then a new address record must be created. If the business name is just changed on the existing record then the wrong information could be linked to other records/arrests/case files etc  Try multiple variations/spellings of names (e.g. Catherine might be on the system under Kate or Katie, Steven as Steve and Stephen, Claire as Clare or Clair etc) Ð see wildcards  Using wildcards (*) can be useful to help account for variations in records, especially if the spelling of a name is unclear. For example, searching for SMITH, C* will return all records for the surname ÔSMITHÕ which have a forename beginning with ÔCÕ o Wildcards can also replace letters in the middle of words o 3.1.4 Gender / Gender Title Every Person record must include a gender, from the drop down menu select one of the following:  Male Ð must include title of ÔMrÕ, this is not specific to someoneÕs age  Female Ð Must include title of Miss (if under 16), Ms, Mrs as appropriate  Unknown Ð leave the title blank as this by definition will also be unknown  Other o Dr o PC o Lord * Never add one of these ÔotherÕ titles to a name field Each person record has a name ÔTypeÕ, the following options are available from the dropdown menu:  Filename  Alias  Alternative spelling  Former name  Maiden name  Nickname  PNC filename The ÔfilenameÕ should always be the current and legal name of the person in question. 3.1.5 Business addresses There should be a separate address record created every time a new business takes over a premises. If an address with the correct business name does not exist on Niche always create a new record - NEVER change an existing record. Creating/ Verifying new business addresses:  Do all you can to confirm an existing record isnÕt already on Niche  Make sure that the full address (including unit, building name or number, postcode, street name etc) is correct  If the address on the Gazetteer doesnÕt include the business name or the business name is incorrect then verify as the appropriate premises name (including exact unit/building name or number) and then manually change the business name on the Niche address record and tick the ÔNon-standardÕ box o In this case ALWAYS email the DQT to advise them so the Gazetteer can be updated Verifying existing business addresses: This can include historic or current businesses.  Before verifying make a note of the exact business name on the existing record 
