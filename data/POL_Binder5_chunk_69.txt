consists of or incorporates a missile designed, on account of its having a jacket and hard-core, to penetrate armour plating, armour screening or body armour (section 5(1A)(e)); o Section 5(1A)(e) is typified by tungsten-cored rounds designed to penetrate armour using kinetic energy alone. It extends to depleted uranium rounds and armour piercing discarding sabot ammunition. xvii) any ammunition which is designed to be used with a pistol and incorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact (section 5(1A)(f)); o Section 5(1A)(f) refers to ammunition incorporating a projectile that is designed or adapted to expand in a controlled manner. Semi-jacketed soft point and hollow point are typical forms of expanding ammunition, but care must be taken to distinguish between expanding ammunition which is solely designed for use in pistols and expanding ammunition for use in rifles - only expanding ammunition for pistols is prohibited, whereas expanding ammunition for rifles is subject to section 1 controls and may be held on a firearms certificate. All bullets will distort on impact, but only those which were designed or adapted to do so in a predictable manner fit this category. xviii) anything which is designed to be projected as a missile from any weapon and is designed to be, or has been incorporated in, any ammunition falling within any of the preceding paragraphs (see xv, xvi and xvii above); or any ammunition which would fall within any of those paragraphs but for it being specified at (xi) above (section 5(1A)(g)); o Section 5(1A)(g) extends the prohibition on the various types of prohibited ammunition to the actual bullet or missile itself, not just the complete round of ammunition (a complete round consists of the bullet, the cartridge case, the propellant and the primer).

Adding to the list of prohibited weapons 3.6 Section 1(4) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 enables the Secretary of State, subject to the approval of Parliament, to make an Order adding to the list of prohibited weapons and ammunition. This power applies only in respect of: a) any firearm (not being an air weapon) which is not for the time being specified in subsection (1) of section 5 of the 1968 Act, was not lawfully on sale in Great Britain in substantial numbers at any time before 1988 and appears to the Secretary of State to be: i) specially dangerous (see Chapter 2); or ii) wholly or partly composed of
