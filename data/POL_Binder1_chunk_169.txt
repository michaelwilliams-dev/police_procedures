Accid Anal Prev 40:1088-95. 7 Musculoskeletal complications arising from the intense muscle contraction induced by the Taser discharge 38. There are two case reports of compression fractures of the thoracic spine following exposure to Taser X26 discharge.21 It is thought that these fractures, which were observed in young police officers during Taser training, resulted from discharge-induced muscle contraction. 39. It is conceivable that individuals affected by the age-related condition, osteoporosis, may be more susceptible to this type of injury, whether from the Taser-induced muscle contractions or from the application of other forms of physical force.22 Injuries from Taser-induced falls 40. The muscle contractions induced by Taser discharge commonly lead to loss of the ability to maintain an upright posture and can lead to falls. 41. In the United States, at least six fatal head injuries have been linked to the use of Taser.6 There are no reported cases of this type in the UK. 42. Individuals intoxicated with alcohol, illicit drugs or certain prescription medications may be at heightened risk of sustaining fall injuries, as postural control and any residual protective fall- arresting reflexes could be impaired. Falls from height may be a particular risk for persons whose perception of the environment has been impaired by alcohol or drug intoxication. 43. Persons affected by osteoporosis may be at greater risk of fractures from Taser-induced falls. 44. During the adolescent growth period (typically 12- to 14-years-old), children are at a heightened risk of bone fracture (particularly of the distal end of the radius or ulna).23 During this period, children may be at greater risk of sustaining fractures following falls. 45. Falls could lead to cuts, abrasions and blunt trauma, which may be of particular concern in individuals with a bleeding or clotting disorder and those on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.24 In people affected by blood-borne pathogens (e.g. viral hepatitis, HIV) cuts and abrasions may be associated with a secondary risk to others who may come into contact with the affected individual. 46. People with diabetes who are taking antidiabetic drugs in the thiazolidinedione class (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) may be at enhanced risk of fractures.25 Injuries from tissue penetration of the Taser barbs 47. The Taser X26 barbs used in the UK have a length of nearly 10 mm. When striking compressible tissue, the effective penetration depth may be greater. The barbs therefore have the potential to injure deeper structures. 21 Winslow, JE et al (2007). Ann Emerg Med 50:584-6; Sloane, CM et al (2008).
