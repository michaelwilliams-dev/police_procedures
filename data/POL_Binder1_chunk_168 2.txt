of cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators has been recently reviewed.17 The authors concluded that the evidence indicated that discharges from the conducted energy devices like the Taser do not exert effects on device function that would be injurious to health. 13 Fishbein, MC (2010).

The possible effects of Taser discharge on other implanted electronic devices, such as vagus nerve stimulators used in the management of drug-resistant epilepsy and depression, are unknown. Spontaneous abortion and other implications for fetal well-being 29. The risks to the pregnant woman and fetus from Taser discharge are poorly understood. 30. A case report describes spontaneous abortion in an 11-week pregnant, 32-year-old woman seven days after being subjected to discharge from a conducted energy device.18 One of the device?s barbs had lodged in the abdominal skin overlying the uterus, while the second barb had lodged in the left thigh. Spotting occurred one day after exposure to discharge and the woman miscarried six days later. 31. Amnesty International report a second case in which fetal death was diagnosed some 12 hours after exposure to Taser discharge.19 32. In both of the above cases, the contribution of the Taser discharge (or of any other force used at the time) to the reported adverse outcomes is uncertain. 33. It has been suggested that Taser-induced muscle contractions in pregnant women may lead to induction of labour or other obstetric complications. DOMILL is unaware of any evidence either to substantiate or alleviate these concerns. 34. Fall injuries have been associated with a significantly increased probability of delivery by caesarian section and low birth weight20, and these may be additional factors to consider when planning to use a Taser on a woman who is known to be pregnant or in the post-incident medical management of a pregnant woman who has been subjected to Taser discharge. 35. No pregnancy-associated adverse outcomes in the UK have emerged during DOMILL?s on- going review of injury data from Taser incidents. Burns from an interaction of the Taser discharge current with the skin 36. Although minor skin burns are a recognised complication in Taser use, there is no evidence to suggest that these have clinically significant implications (as gauged from the absence of clinical case reports relating to this type of injury). 37. There is no reason to believe that children or other vulnerable groups will be differentially susceptible to this form of superficial injury. 18 Mehl, LE (1992).
