Deputies. Through individual meetings, they should appeal to the left-wing Democratic Party and the centrist Five Star Movement, which collectively accounts for 120 members of the Chamber of Deputies, to increase support. Furthermore, Meloni and Schillaci should encourage young doctors who went on strike to stage rallies in favor of the bill to demonstrate popularity. Young doctors would likely do so because the bill addresses many of the concerns that caused them to strike. To address criticism of immigration, they should emphasize that the policy specifically targets a doctor shortage that Italians alone cannot resolve. By emphasizing this aspect, the Italian government can reduce opposition to the plan and limit hostility towards foreign doctors.32 Additionally, they can highlight how Germany has implemented similar policies while increasing border controls, demonstrating that passing the SWA does not signal weakness in immigration policy. Another potential criticism is that hiring foreign doctors may strain resources. Prime Minister Meloni and Minister Schillaci should emphasize the policyÕs cost- effectiveness and how migrant doctors would contribute economically by filling positions left vacant by locals.33 Although ItalyÕs right-wing government may be more inclined than others to pass a Skilled Workers Act, no right- wing government with anti- immigration rhetoric has yet passed a pro-immigration bill. Thus, the bill is unlikely to pass in the near future but could pass if a more centrist or left-wing government was elected.
