PACE Code I. Following an issue of a warrant for further detention, the duty inspector should conduct a daily welfare check for each detainee at least once in every 24-hour period.

Exercise PACE Code H, paragraph 8.7 and PACE Code I, paragraph 8.6 state that, as a minimum requirement, brief outdoor exercise shall be offered if practicable. Where facilities exist, indoor exercise should be offered as an alternative if outside conditions are such that a detainee cannot be reasonably expected to take outdoor exercise or if requested by the detainee for reasons of security. CTPHQ and wider CT policing routinely make provision for one hour of exercise a day. In addition to being offered opportunities for this daily exercise, TACT/section 27 National Security Act 2023 detainees should also be offered access to natural light. Read more about exercise. Visits to detainees As TACT/section 27 National Security Act 2023 detainees are potentially subject to longer periods of detention, visits from friends or family amount to an important welfare consideration (see section 5.4 of Code H and section 5.3 of Code I). Custody officers should liaise with the CT SIO to discuss visitor-related aspects of detainee welfare. Buildings and facilities TACT and National Security Act 2023 custody suites are designed in line with specific Ministry of Justice guidance. They differ in their specification from standard or volume custody suites. Read more about building and facilities.
