Scottish Ministers (by virtue of provision made under section 63 of the Scotland Act 1998). (4) This section has effect without prejudice to section 58(2) of the 1968 Act (antique firearms). 9.5 In broad terms, section 7 of the 1997 Act divides historic handguns, other than antiques and muzzle-loaders, into two classes: those which may be kept at home without ammunition, and those which may be kept and fired at a designated secure site. 9.6 Set out below is an explanation of how the terms of section 7 might apply in practice. Historic handguns which might be kept at home 9.7 The police may grant a firearm certificate for a firearm to be kept at home (as opposed to at a designated site) under the terms of section 7(1) if the normal criteria for the grant of a certificate are satisfied and if the firearm meets all of three tests: (i) it must be of a kind for which the Secretary of State has decided that ammunition is not readily available in the UK; (ii) the actual gun (not just the make or model) must have been manufactured before 1 January 1919; and (iii) the certificate must be subject to a condition that the gun must be kept or exhibited as part of a collection. 9.8 Section 7(2) gives the Secretary of State the power to list by Statutory Instrument those firearms to which section 7(1)(b) applies and therefore do not require an authority from the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers.

The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 (Firearms of Historic Interest) Order 1997 (SI 19997/1537) is made under this power, and states that the following types of firearm are subject to section 7(1): All small firearms as defined by section 5(1)(aba) of the Firearms Act 1968 (small firearms) except those chambered for the following types of ammunition. These are set out in The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 (Firearms of Historic Interest) Order 1997 (Statutory instrument 1997/1537) as follows:  22Ó rim-fire  .25Ó ACP/6.35mm  .25Ó Ð 20  .32Ó ACP/7.65mm  .32Ó Ð 20  .32Ó Smith & Wesson Long  7.62mm Soviet Tokarev  .38Ó 40 Winchester  .380 ACP/9mm short  9mm Luger/Parabellum/9x19mm  .38 Smith & Wesson  .38Ó Special  .38-200  .44Ó Special  .44Ó Ð 40 Winchester  .45 ACP  .45Ó Colt Revolver 9.9 This is a statutory provision, and any gun chambered for the above types of ammunition cannot benefit from the provisions of section 7(1) and (2).
