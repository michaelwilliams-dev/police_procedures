For advice on where to store such images obtained in the course of an investigation, you must contact the relevant investigatory team (i.e. CIET, FCIU, CSI). Niche RMS may not be the most appropriate storage area for distressing images either. Before adding an image to Niche, you must consider other appropriate storage areas (for example is it something that should be stored by South West Forensics?). If there is a requirement to store a distressing image on Niche, you must consider whether that image would cause upset/distress to other users. If so, you must ensure that the document name contains a warning and you add a warning to the first page of the document so when opened it clearly states Òdistressing/upsetting images are contained within this reportÓ. If you are in doubt about where/how to store your image, please contact the Data Quality team. 1.1.5 STORM Command and Control Incident o Call Origin o Type Code o Incident Description o Location (grid reference; BCU; sector) o Grade o Qualifiers o NSIR opening and closing codes o Person information (section 2.1.1) o Address o Date and time Source o Forename and Surname Ð no abbreviations o Address (grid reference, postcode) o Date of Birth o Telephone number o Gender o Ethnicity o Annex B Ð Data Quality Standards Ð Detailed Standards 2.1 Additional Information Required and Ownership 2.1.1 Person Records Ð Detailed Data Standards Ð Entity Person Standard Ownership Notes No person should be created if another person record exists with the same:  Forename  Surname  DOB Plus either address, phone number, email, PNC ID etc Creator/ Linker If a duplicate record is created before
