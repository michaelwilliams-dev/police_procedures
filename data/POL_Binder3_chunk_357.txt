in real- world settings. Policy Analysis Specific technologies show potential in the Southwest. Solutions like N-DripÔs gravity- powered drip irrigation system help farmers conserve water by replacing the outdated flood irrigation method still used in nearly 40% of the regionÔs farms.6 This system can reduce water use by up to 70% without requiring pumps or energy, which is particularly suited to areas like California and Arizona where water scarcity is a more pressing issue.6 Digital tools, such as Acuity Agriculture's dashboard, provide farmers with real-time data on soil moisture and climate conditions to help them optimize irrigation practices and meet strict water usage regulations. Additionally, indoor and vertical farming technologies, which use recycled water and AI-controlled systems, have emerged as key innovations for growing crops with up to 95% less water, helping reduce issues with the regionÔs water supply draining. Together, these technologies are essential for adapting to the SouthwestÔs rapidly changing water landscape, which is driven by both population growth and climate change. The USDA and Congress could maximize the effectiveness of these technologies through SAIRPÔs joint loan program by providing essential funding for initial implementation and scaling. By backing innovations like N-DripÔs energy-free irrigation and Acuity AgricultureÕs data-driven soil monitoring, SAIRP helps farmers transition from outdated methods without bearing high upfront costs. Additionally, USDA-led coordination ensures farmers have access to training and technical support, minimizing barriers to adoption. While initial costs are high, the long-term savings in water and increased crop yields can offset these expenses, investing in a sustainable solution for both the government and farmers. Highlights  Increasing droughts and wildfires threaten water resources in the Southwestern United States, highlighting the need for sustainable agricultural practices and new technologies to protect water availability.1  Agriculture uses roughly 70% of global freshwater.1 The SouthwestÕs reliance on limited water sources and vulnerable watersheds calls for innovative resource management and conservation.  The Southwest Agricultural Innovation and Resilience Program (SAIRP) would provide $5 billion in federal loans and grants through the USDA, targeting irrigation, drought-resistant crops, and digital monitoring technologies.4,5  With federal support, technologies like N-Drip irrigation and AI soil monitoring can reduce water use by up to 70%, improve crop yields, and adapt farming practices to the regionÕs evolving climate challenges.6 Implementation To implement SAIRP once approved, Congress and the USDA could model the initiative on existing green energy acts, such as the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP - H.R. 5051), which provides grants and loan guarantees to agricultural producers and rural businesses for energy- efficient projects.7 Similar to REAP, SAIRP could offer grants and subsidized loans specifically targeting water-saving technologies and data-driven agricultural practices that align with the programÕs environmental goals. Additionally, SAIRP could draw on lessons from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which allocates funding for clean energy and sustainable farming practices, providing tax credits to incentivize eco-friendly investments.8 A portion of the IRAÕs clean energy and agricultural sustainability funding could be redirected or earmarked specifically for SAIRPÕs objectives.
