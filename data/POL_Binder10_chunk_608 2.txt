have been or are still being forcibly subjected to FGM and it is accordingly regarded as an extreme form of Domestic and Child Abuse. In Wiltshire, if the FGM is believed to have taken place on a female under the age of 18 it will be investigated by the Child Abuse Investigation Team (CAIT) with support from the Safeguarding Team for the wider family and, where necessary, obtaining a protective order, and if the FGM has taken place on a female over the age of 18 it will be investigated by the Safeguarding Team both of which sit within the Public Protection Department. Indicators of risk may include:  Family comes from practising community  Family is not well integrated into British society  Parents do not want their children to have sexual health classes at school  Child talking about taking a long holiday to a country where practice is prevalent  Child talking about a Ôspecial eventÕ or party where she is going to become a woman  Children who take a significant amount of time whilst urinating  Any female child born to a woman or who has a sister subjected to FGM must be considered at risk along with any female children in immediate and extended family. HBA has the potential to be both a Domestic Abuse and a Child Abuse concern as well as a crime and a non-crime. In terms of the DASH risk assessment, HBA is a major risk factor for victims and must be regarded as a significant predictor of the likelihood of future harm or homicide. Consideration should therefore be given to grading all incidents with a HBA factor as high risk.
