section 7(1) and (2). The police have no power to waive the terms of the Statutory Instrument and allow firearms of these chamberings to be kept at home. Likewise, further ammunition can only be declared Òreadily availableÓ by the Secretary of State. Handguns covered by the list would include, for example, the Browning Models 1900, 1906 and 1910, the Colt 1917 in .45Ó ACP, the Mauser c96 in 9mm Parabellum, the P08 Luger in 9mm, and the Webley 1906 as the ammunition for these may be available. However, guns of these types might benefit from the terms of section 7(3). 9.10 As well as being a type for which ammunition is not readily available, the individual gun (not just the make or model) must have been manufactured before 1 January 1919. This date was chosen to include both guns of the First World War era and the work of the smaller gunsmiths in the UK or abroad who ceased production before or during the Great War. This is a statutory requirement, and the police cannot grant a firearm certificate for a pistol made after this date to be kept at home under section 7(1). The police will therefore wish to be satisfied that the gun falls within this category. 9.11 Certain types of gun stopped being made before 1919. These would include the following: 65 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law Adams revolvers Colt: Model 1873 and Model 1878 revolvers in .450, .455 and .476 calibre Enfield Mk I and Mk II .476 service revolvers Kynoch revolvers Lancaster four and two-barrelled pistols (Òhowdah pistolsÓ) Smith & Wesson Model No.3 revolver in .450, and .455 calibre Smith & Wesson .22 rim-fire tip-up Model 1 First, Second and Third Issues.
