firearm is from a particular or specific personal commission from a manufacturer this should be considered when judging rarity. Many firearms have increased in rarity since the introduction of the 1997 Act and this should be borne in mind when making decisions relating to rarity. 9.32 Collections of historic firearms in the UK include examples of most firearms found worldwide. If a pistol is rarely found in the UK then it will generally be rare in international terms and thus probably worthy of preservation. 9.33 The following makes and models of gun from the 1919-1945 period would not normally be considered rare, unless the individual example had clear distinguishing characteristics. 9.34 Applications submitted in this category may be considered on their individual merits: Astra: Models 400, 600 and 900 Beretta: M 1934 pistol in 9mm short and M 1935 pistol in 7.65mm Browning FN: Model 1935 (also known as GP, Grand Puissance or High Power) in 9mm Parabellum Colt: Model 1911 in .45 ACP, Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless in.32ACP, Model 1908 in .25ACP, Model 1908 in .380ACP, 73 Guide on Firearms Licensing Law Model 1917 revolver in .45ÓACP, Official Police, Police Positive, Police Positive Special, Detective Special CZ: M27 7.65mm pistol Enfield: Service .38 No2 (including Albion-made) revolvers (all marks) Frommer: Model .37 pistol in 7.65mm Luger: (see ÒParabellumÓ) MAB: Model D pistol in 7.65mm Mauser: Model 1934 pistol in .32ACP, Model HS c pistol in .32ACP ÔParabellum-typeÕ: P 08 nominal 4Ó barrel 9mm pistol marked S/42 byf(Mauser) Radom: VIS 35 pistol in 9mm Parabellum Sauer: Model 38 H pistol in 7.65mm Smith & Wesson: ÒMilitary and PoliceÓ (K frame) Ðversion in .38 S&W (.38-200) Star: Model B pistol in 9mm Parabellum Tokarev: Model TT 33 pistol in 7.62mm Walther: Model 8 pistol in 6.35, Model PP and Model PPK pistols in .32 and .380ACP, P38 pistol in 9mm Parabellum Parabellum Unique: Model 17 pistol (Kriegsmodell) Webley: Mark IV revolver in .38 S&W (.38-200) calibre, though several variants might qualify as ÒrareÓ 9.35 Guns made after 1945 may not generally be considered rare or of historic interest in themselves. However, exemptions to this would be models of which only a few examples were made, or now exist in the UK, for example the Jurek, the Sterling revolver and the Victory Arms Co self-loading pistol. Also those incorporating innovative production techniques or designs may be considered rare and therefore warrant preservation.
