This scoping review aims to map initiatives aimed at enhancing interactions between older adults and police and evaluates outcomes. Findings inform the development of a geriatrics-focused police training curriculum to support age-friendly policing. A literature search across major databases and grey literature yielded 20 relevant publications. Three main initiatives were identified: geriatrics-oriented training programs, specialized geriatric police units and geriatrics-oriented policing guidelines. These insights highlight effective strategies for improving police responses to aging-related challenges and guide future research and policy in this domain. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a scoping review methodology guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual and PRISMA-ScR checklist. A comprehensive search strategy was developed and executed across multiple databases and grey literature sources. Screening and selection of relevant studies were conducted in duplicate, with data extraction focusing on key elements such as study objectives, design, interventions and outcomes. Thematic analysis was employed to synthesize findings from included studies, highlighting three principal initiatives: geriatrics-oriented training programs, specialized geriatric police units and geriatrics-oriented policing guidelines. This approach aimed to map existing evidence, inform the development of a geriatrics-focused training curriculum and identify best practices for age-friendly policing. Findings The scoping review identified 28 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Findings highlighted varied approaches to enhancing police interactions with older adults, emphasizing training as pivotal. Effective strategies included specialized units, tailored training programs and guidelines integrating geriatrics principles. Key outcomes encompassed improved officer knowledge, communication skills and attitudes toward older adults, fostering enhanced service delivery and community relations. Evidence underscored the importance of ongoing education and collaborative partnerships in optimizing policing responses to aging populations, advocating for sustainable, age-friendly policing practices. Research limitations/implications The review√ïs limitations stem from primarily English-language studies, potentially overlooking non-English literature. Variability in study designs and outcomes poses challenges to synthesizing findings comprehensively. Limited generalizability may result due to geographic and cultural differences in policing
