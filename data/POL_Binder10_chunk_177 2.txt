given area (i.e. notifying staff, stand by to evacuate, full evacuation). Storey exit A final exit or a doorway giving direct access into a protected stairway, firefighting lobby, or external escape route. Travel distance The actual distance to be travelled by a person from any point within the floor area to the nearest storey exit or final exit, having regard to the layout of walls, partitions and fixings. Vision panel A transparent panel in a wall or door of an inner room enabling the occupant to become aware of a fire in the access area during the early stages. Way guidance Where necessary Low mounted luminous tracks positioned on escape routes in combination with exit indicators, exit marking and intermediate direction indicators along the route, provided for use when the supply to the normal lighting fails, which do not rely on an electrical supply for their luminous output. The Order requires that fire precautions (such as firefighting equipment, fire detection and warning, and emergency routes and exits) should be provided (and maintained) Ôwhere necessaryÕ. What this means is that the fire precautions you must provide (and maintain) are those which are needed to reasonably protect relevant persons from risks to them in case of fire. This will be determined by the findings of your risk assessment including the preventative measures you have or will have taken. In practice, it is very unlikely, that a properly conducted fire risk assessment, which takes into account all the matters relevant for the safety of persons in case of fire, will conclude that no fire precautions (including maintenance) are necessary. Young person (a) A person aged 16 years, from the date on which he attains that age until and including the 31st August which next follows that date. (b) A person aged 16 years and over who is undertaking a course of full-time education at a school or college which is not advanced education. (c) A person aged 16 years and over who is undertaking approved training that is not provided through a contract of employment. For the purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) the person: (a) shall have commenced the course of full-time education or approved training before attaining the age of 19 years; and (b) shall not have attained the age of 20 years. 132 References The following documents are referenced in this guide.
