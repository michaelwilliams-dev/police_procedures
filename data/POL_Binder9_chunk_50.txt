wishes to continue the interview but does not already have a second set of recording media, they should obtain a set. The interviewee should not be left unattended in the interview room. The person conducting the interview should remove the recording media from the recorder and insert the new recording media, which, if practicable, should be unwrapped or otherwise opened in the interviewee√ïs presence. The recorder should then be set to record on the new recording media. Care should be taken, particularly when a number of sets of recording media have been used, to ensure that there is no confusion between them. This may be done by marking the recording media with an identification number immediately after they are removed from the recorder. Taking a break during interview 229. When a break is to be taken during the course of an interview and the interview room is to be vacated by the interviewee, the fact that a break is to be taken, the reason for it and the time should be recorded on the recording media.
