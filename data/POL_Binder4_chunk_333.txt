(See end of Document for details) View outstanding changes For the purposes of any police services agreement which is required to be in force by virtue of sub-paragraph (2), other than one which was entered into before commencement, section 25A of the 1982 Act (as it had effect immediately before commencement) continues to apply in relation to the aerodrome as if it continued to be a designated airport. In the following provisions of this paragraph, a police services agreement which is required to be in force in relation to an aerodrome by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) is referred to as a designated airport police services agreement. A designated airport police services agreement ceases to be in force immediately before a police services agreement is required to be in force in relation to the aerodrome by virtue of the amendments made by paragraph 5 of this Schedule (unless the designated airport police services agreement has previously ceased to be in force). Except as provided by sub-paragraph (5), nothing in Part 1 of this Schedule affects the operation of a designated airport police services agreement or the application of the following provisions of the 1982 Act in relation to such an agreementâ section 26(2B); section 29A(1), (2)(a) and (3) and sections 29B to 29D. So far as is necessary for the purposes of this paragraph, section 31 of the 1982 Act (as it had effect immediately before commencement) continues to have effect. In this paragraphâ âcommencementâ means the commencement of section 80; âthe 1982 Actâ means the Aviation Security Act 1982 (c. 36). Repeal of section 30 of the 1982 Act (1) The repeal of section 30 of the 1982 Act by paragraph 11 of this Schedule does not affectâ the validity of an order made under that section (âa section 30 orderâ) before commencement, or the operation of subsections (4) and (5) of that section in relation to such an order. In relation to any time on or after commencement, any reference in a provision of a section 30 order to a designated airport is (if that provision is capable of having continuing effect) to be read as a reference to a relevant aerodrome. In this paragraph âcommencementâ and âthe 1982 Actâ have the same meanings as in paragraph 14.
