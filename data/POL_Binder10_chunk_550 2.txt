REFUSING GIFTS & HOSPITALITY Where the motivation behind the offer or the prevailing circumstances are inappropriate or could be perceived by the public as such then the offer must be refused there and then and the matter declared immediately via the electronic register. 4.1 Unacceptable gifts & hospitality There is no exhaustive list of circumstances where a gift or hospitality should be immediately refused, however, in the following examples offers must be refused regardless of the value or form that the gift or hospitality may take:  Gifts of thanks or tokens of affection from a member of the public that is or could be reasonably suspected to be an attempt to initiate or pursue a sexual or otherwise inappropriate relationship.  Individuals or groups seeking to achieve some form of political objective.  Individuals or groups seeking to prevent (by lawful means or otherwise) members of the public (as individuals, companies or employees) conducting a lawful activity.   Individuals or groups involved in criminality or who advocate either active or passive non- compliance with the law.  A cash payment (other than donations to specific Police charities or Police supported charities)  A financial reward resulting from the publication of articles relating to the recipientÕs role or duties as a member of the Police Service.
