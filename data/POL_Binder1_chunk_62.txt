Extra-Territorial Offences Section 4(1) of the 2003 Act extends sections 1 to 3 to extra-territorial acts so that it is also an offence for a UK national or UK resident to:  perform FGM outside the UK (sections 4 and 1 of the 2003 Act);  assist a girl to perform FGM on herself outside the UK (sections 4 and 2 of the 2003 Act); and  assist (from outside the UK) a non-UK national or UK resident to carry out FGM outside the UK on a UK national or UK resident (sections 4 and 3 of the 2003 Act). The extra-territorial offences are intended to cover taking a girl abroad to be subjected to FGM. By virtue of section 1(4) of the 2003 Act, the exceptions set out in sections 1(2) and (3) also apply to the extra-territorial offences. Section 4(1A) of the 2003 Act provides that an offence under section 3A can be committed wholly or partly outside the UK by a person who is a UK national or UK resident. 3.1.3 Other Offences Under provisions of the law which apply generally to criminal offences it is also an offence to:  aid, abet, counsel or procure a person to commit an FGM offence23;  encourage or assist a person to commit an FGM offence24  attempt to commit an FGM offence25: and  conspire to commit an FGM offence26. Any person found guilty of such an offence faces the same maximum penalty as for the offences under the 2003 Act. 23 Common law. 24 Sections 44-46 of the Serious Crime Act 2007. 25 Section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. 26 Section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. 3.1.4 WHO Classifications of FGM and the 2003 Act Excision and infibulation are examples of what constitutes mutilation for the purpose of the 2003 Act but the term ÒmutilateÓ is not defined in the Act. The interpretation of the legislation, including whether a particular procedure amounts to mutilation, is a matter for the criminal courts to determine in cases brought before them. In the absence of any conviction for FGM, there is currently no criminal case law on what does or does not amount to mutilation for the purpose of the 2003 Act. The World Health Organisation (WHO) classifications of FGM and section 1 of the 2003 Act were, however, considered by the Family Court in the context of care proceedings in the case of B and G (Children) (No 2)27. In his judgment of 15 January 201528, the President of the Family Division said (at paragraph 11): ÒIt will be seen that for the purposes of the criminal law what is prohibited is to Òexcise, infibulate or otherwise mutilateÓ the Òwhole or any partÓ of the Òlabia majora, labia minora or clitoris.Ó This brings within the ambit of the criminal law all forms of FGM of WHO Types I, II and III (including, it may be noted, Type 1a29).
