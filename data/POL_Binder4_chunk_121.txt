strike. To address criticism of immigration, they should emphasize that the policy specifically targets a doctor shortage that Italians alone cannot resolve. By emphasizing this aspect, the Italian government can reduce opposition to the plan and limit hostility towards foreign doctors.32 Additionally, they can highlight how Germany has implemented similar policies while increasing border controls, demonstrating that passing the SWA does not signal weakness in immigration policy. Another potential criticism is that hiring foreign doctors may strain resources. Prime Minister Meloni and Minister Schillaci should emphasize the policyâs cost- effectiveness and how migrant doctors would contribute economically by filling positions left vacant by locals.33 Although Italyâs right-wing government may be more inclined than others to pass a Skilled Workers Act, no right- wing government with anti- immigration rhetoric has yet passed a pro-immigration bill. Thus, the bill is unlikely to pass in the near future but could pass if a more centrist or left-wing government was elected.
