creation, the National Guard has been highly problematic in adhering to human rights. Furthermore, the Organization of American Statesâ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) revealed that Mexico has largely not adhered to its human rights suggestions. In 2022, the IACHR recommended that Mexico ensure investigations into cases of forced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, and torture involving the National Guard, holding both the direct perpetrators and those in the chain of command accountable.3 The IACHR report noted that no senior civilian or military officials were sentenced by Mexico for torture or forced disappearances in 2020 or 2021.3 Moreover, military and government figures allegedly tried to manipulate legal outcomes for favors during the Tlatlaya massacre in which Mexican soldiers killed 22 suspects in a grain warehouse, including 12 to 15 who were executed after surrendering.3,4 IAHCRâs report conveys that Mexicoâs militarization of the National Guard has enabled armed forces to operate without transparency or accountability, leading to more human rights violations. Policy Idea Mexican senators and deputies not aligned with Sheinbaumâs Sigamos Haciendo Historia political alliance should lobby President Sheinbaum to implement accountability measures in Mexicoâs National Guard, pressuring her to implement long overdue public security measures outlined by the Organization of American Statesâ Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). First, deputies should lobby for the state to report civilian casualties and prosecute national guardsmen or their superior officers involved in any human rights abuse cases. Next, Mexican senators should raise the same concern with the president, urging her to comply with the IACHRâs policy recommendations that Mexico has yet to address, such as establishing an independent body to oversee public security operations to ensure accountability within the National Guard. Policy Analysis Mexico adopting IACHR recommendations will help combat human rights abuses by establishing a framework for Mexico to implement accountability reforms. For example, in 2019, the IACHR ruled that Mexico must adopt a law regarding the use of force per international human rights standards.3 In the same year, Mexico adopted the National Law on the Use of Force, which requires detailed reporting and accountability measures for superiors in cases of unlawful force.3 IACHR concluded that Mexico has fully adhered to their suggestion ever since.5 While Mexico implemented this IACHR recommendation, Sheinbaumâs fervent support for militarization conveys that the Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies should lobby for the president to implement more IACHR reforms to address the National Guardâs human rights abuses, given that they are the direct channel between communities experiencing human rights violations and the government. Although Mexico has adopted some IACHR reforms, further action is needed to hold the National Guard accountable. IACHRâs involvement in the Barrios Alto case in Peru demonstrates how their reforms can hold Latin American militaries accountable. On November 3rd, 1991, Peruvian military officials killed 15 people in the Barrios Alto neighborhood on false suspicions of terrorism.6 Later, the Peruvian Congress adopted an amnesty law that exonerated army members who committed human rights violations between 1980 and 1995.6 In 2001, the IACHR ruled that
