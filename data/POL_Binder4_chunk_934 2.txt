Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance Chapter 5 â Different experiences, needs and related considerations As outlined in âChapter 3 â Recognising Domestic Abuseâ, individuals can be the victims of multiple and different abusive behaviours. It is important to consider the different protected characteristics and related experiences of victims, and how these may intersect and overlap particularly in relation to accessing services and support if they are not adequately designed to meet specific needs. Age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation are protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010. Other factors, such as an individualâs immigration status or socio-economic position can also impact access to services. The impacts of abuse can be compounded, for example, where victims face multiple disadvantages. Commissioners, service providers and statutory agencies should consider different experiences, needs and voices when developing their responses to both adult and child victims, to fully identify the experiences of all victims, vis-Ã -vis the abusive behaviour they are subject to and ensure that services are provided to victims without discrimination.

The offer of support should be based on the victimâs needs and all services should be offered without discrimination of any kind. For further information on the Victims Code see âChapter 6 â Agency Response to Domestic Abuseâ. As outlined in âChapter 4 â Impact of Domestic Abuseâ, there are many practical and psychological barriers that victims may face when accessing support, including for example: feelings of shame or guilt, fear of what the perpetrator will do to them, or a belief that the situation might get better. Other factors that can create additional barriers to a victim accessing support are listed below: Impact of coercive control and trauma â the abuse may make the victim feel isolated, worthless, to feel they are to blame for the abuse and/or be convinced they cannot look after themselves; Domestic Abuse Act 2021 Statutory Guidance Shame and stigma â including fear of not being believed, feeling shame around disclosing abuse and/or being able to access support; Economic dependence/instability â the victim may not have access to resources they need to be able to support themselves or their children independently, or may not be able to afford legal representation; Living in a rural community â a victim may face increased isolation from support networks and lack of access to services if they are living in a rural community compared to an urban
