Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub- paragraph (1)(b), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. Nothing in this paragraph affects the power of the court at any subsequent hearing to remand the person afresh. (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessâ the person is remanded on bail, and both that person and the person who applied for the injunction consent to a longer period. (2) Where the court has power to remand a person in custody it may, if the remand is for a period not exceeding 3 clear days, commit the person to the custody of a constable. Further remand (1) If the court is satisfied that a person who has been remanded is unable by reason of illness or accident to appear or be brought before the court at the expiration of the period of remand, the court may, in the absence of the person, further remand the person. The power mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may (in the person's absence) enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. The enlargement of the person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. Paragraph 4(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this
