WILTSHIRE POLICE REST DAY WORKING / SHORT NOTICE CHANGES TO WORKING PATTERNS (OFFICERS & STAFF) Author S WILLIAMS Department HUMAN RESOURCES Date of Publication APRIL 2012 Review Date APRIL 2015 Technical Author T RODRIGUEZ NOT PROTECTIVELY MARKED/UNCLASSIFIED REST DAY / FREE DAY WORKING - POLICE OFFICERS Where an officer is required to do duty on a rostered rest day, the recompense varies with the amount of notice given and the rank of the officer. Both full and part time officers are compensated in the same way for rest day working. Recompense for Rest Day Working Ð Constables and Sergeants Amount of Notice Recompense Notes Less than 15 days in advance of the planned starting time Time and a half Minimum payment of 4 hours Any other case Another rest day, notified within 4 days of notification of the requirement to work (When calculating the number of daysÕ notice given, both the day on which the requirement was notified and the day on which the officer is required to do the duty, should be disregarded.) Where an officer is retained on duty into a rest day and the period worked on the rest day is less than one hour, the minimum four hour payment does NOT apply. The time to be reimbursed counts towards the completed 15 minute periods (see under Overtime). A re-rostered rest day should be regarded as a rest day and attract the same compensation should there be a requirement to work upon that day. Recompense for Free Day Working Ð Constables and Sergeants When an officer is required to perform duty on a free day, it attracts the following compensation: Amount of Notice Where only that particular officer could perform the duty Where any officer could perform the duty More than 15 days Free day reallocated within 4 days of it being cancelled Free day reallocated within 4 days of it being cancelled Less than 15 days Additional hours paid at plain time or taken as time
