Substance Misuse Testing Ð Scope The testing regime will be conducted to a scale that is proportional to any identified issues surrounding drug misuse. Testing may be carried out in the following circumstances:  Testing of Police Officers during their probationary period,  Testing with cause (that is, where there is a reasonable suspicion of substance misuse)  As part of a random routine testing regime  Random screening of officers in posts identified by the Chief Officer as being Vulnerable, (safety critical) (vulnerable and security sensitive) The intention of a testing regime is preventive. The testing regime is designed to:  Minimise the chances of substance misusers entering the police service in the first place.  Deter officers from substance misuse through the application of a policy that makes detection a real possibility.  Encourage those with a substance misuse problem to identify them, so that they may be supported in seeking treatment.  Screen officers in vulnerable areas, so as to minimise any risk of operations being prejudiced by impaired judgement.  Protect officers in vulnerable areas in which they may be subject to malicious allegations of substance misuse. There is a power to test all Wiltshire Police staff if it is suspected that a police staff member is misusing controlled drugs.
