Among the 10,924 businesses called at least once, the response rate for the survey was 3% (shown in Table 3.3). This included businesses where no final outcome was reached, for example where the interviewing team were not able to get through to the right person, where an appointment had been made to call back at a later date, or where a or where the call went to answerphone. Among the 2,193 businesses where a definite call outcome was achieved, the response rate was 16% (shown in Table 3.4). 10% of businesses screened out because they confirmed their organisation does not use AI and is not considering deploying it in the future. However, this proportion increases to 48% when based on records where a definitive outcome was reached. The high proportion of businesses screening out and subsequent lower response rate was expected due to the specific eligibility requirement of businesses needing to be using or have plans to use AI.
