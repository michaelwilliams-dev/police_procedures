reforms is the first step to making the National Guard accountable. Building on the Chamber of Deputiesâ work, Mexicoâs senators also not aligned with Sigamos Haciendo Historia, such as Senator Cristina RuÃ­z Sandoval of Mexicoâs Institutional Revolutionary Party, should pressure Sheinbaum directly to implement accountability measures. Like her deputy counterparts, Sandoval opposed militarizing the National Guard, stating that Mexico will risk international sanctions by permanently militarizing its armed forces without adhering to the IACHR ruling that the use of armed forces in public security must be exceptional and temporary.9 Given that Sandoval is on the Senate Human Rights Commission, she is best suited to gather support from like-minded senators and lobby Sheinbaum to implement IACHR reforms. Gathering Senate support to convince the president to implement IACHR reforms remains key to improving accountability in the National Guard. Given Mexicoâs failure to fully enforce accountability within its National Guard, Sheinbaumâs unwavering support of militarization, and a unified government dominated by Sheinbaumâs party, MORENA, Mexican legislators should not lobby for accountability reforms in the National Guard during the next six years of Sheinbaumâs presidency. On November 11, 2024, Mexicoâs Senate approved Sheinbaumâs constitutional reform to empower Mexicoâs Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection (SSPC).10 Approving this reform expands powers of criminal investigation oversight to the SSPC and National Guard.10 Sheinbaumâs reform likely allows the National Guard to continue denying human rights violations, obstructing the IACHRâs call for independent accountability mechanisms in public security operations. Despite the need for reform to ensure the National Guard upholds human rights, the current governmentâs support for militarization suggests that efforts to push for accountability reforms will likely yield minimal substantive progress. To increase the chance of success, legislators should wait until this sexenio (the six-year single term a Mexican president serves) expires and begin to lobby members today to hold the National Guard accountable.
