for minority populations.1,2 CRC is one of the most preventable cancers through adequate early screenings.4 However, typical screening methods, such as colonoscopies, are invasive and lower quality for minority individuals and lead to reduced screening participation among these groups.5,6 To address disparities in CRC treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) should administer self-service kiosks in high- traffic areas for minority populations that distribute culturally tailored Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) kits. Establishing self-service kiosks that distribute FIT kits should be feasible and convenient based on prior implementation of screening kiosks for other diseases and the employment of past FIT kit initiatives; the introduction of community outreach programs should help ensure accessibility for minority populations.10,14,15,16,18,19 Implementation Congress should enact the CRCCPâs proposed policy for self- service kiosks. With the CRCCPâs mobilized support from Congress and current funding to â20 states, 8 universities, 2 tribal organizations, and 5 other organizations,â the CRCCP already serves a substantial portion of the general public and diversifies its support coalition.20 Furthermore, its partnerships with various healthcare organizations allow the CRCCP to improve CRC screening strategies and promote the federal administration of self- service kiosks.20 These pre-existing support networks can be pivotal in promoting the policy through federal avenues. The policy can receive added assistance from the American Cancer Society National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, an organization that supports policy action in key issues surrounding CRC by increasing public awareness and sharing implementation strategies from healthcare organizations.21 Additionally, congressional support for federal screening services, such as the House Ways and Means Committeeâs unanimous passage of multi-cancer early detection bill H.R. 2407 that continues to gain momentum to potentially be passed in Congress, demonstrates such policiesâ viability.22 To ensure proper allocation of the self-service kiosks, the CRCCP should conduct pilot trials to determine which high-traffic areas are optimal and convenient for their target populations; the CRCCP can further place machines in prior kiosksâ locations, such as âfood banks, transit stations, churches, schools, and libraries.â23 In addition, these pilot programs should develop culturally competent FIT kits that minimize language barriers, are comprehensible for a wide audience, and provide simple instructions for comfortable screenings. The aforementioned community outreach groups can also play a vital role in highlighting community residentsâ perceptions and potential methods for improving screening outcomes, leading to the programâs overall expansion and refinement. Healthcare organizations can assist in forming advisory boards by directly hosting meetings in local communities and engaging minority residents, ensuring that their input is applied to the screenings and will benefit those specific areas. There are several other practical considerations for the programâs operation. If modeled off of prior testing kiosks, the maintenance of automated CRC screening kiosks should be minimal given the high proportion of FIT kits in each machine and few costs associated with the actual tests.23 In addition, the kiosk administration should coordinate with laboratories that already process FIT kits or create new centralized laboratory settings to process incoming stool samples.16 After the kit has been tested,
