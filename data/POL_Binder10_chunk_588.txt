Definition of Stress The Health and Safety Executive defines stress as Òthe adverse reaction people have to excessive pressure or other types of demand placed on themÓ. This makes an important distinction between pressure, which can be a positive state if managed correctly, and stress which can be detrimental to health. What causes stress? Many things (or the anticipation of them) can lead to stress:  pressure to perform at work, at school or in sports  threats of physical violence  money worries  arguments  family conflicts  divorce  bereavement  unemployment  moving house  alcohol or drug abuse  Who gets stressed?
