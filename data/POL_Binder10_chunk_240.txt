interests through collaborations with international partners and enable it to play a significant role in building the international infrastructure discussed as part of the third pillar in this Roadmap. Sustainable funding would enable the Turing to provide visible national leadership on matters of AI security and ethics, and use this leadership role and connectivity across the landscape to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of next-generation AI developments, such as those involving machine learning from small data sets, and machine learning as part of wholly new types of neural interface technologies.15 This added focus on how to leap-frog current machine learning-based AI technologies would enable the UK, through the Turing and its network-trusted and neutral status, to also become the place for Explainable AI, bringing us closer to safe, responsible and trustworthy AI. Challenge-led innovation The significant promise of AI and its high risk, high reward, aspirational nature lends itself to goal-directed ÒmoonshotÓ programmes in the style often associated with ARPA-esque models.16a Properly designed and delivered moonshot programmes play to AIÕs strengths by requiring people to work across boundaries and existing organisational structures, and to build new relationships, networks and common languages in order to develop entirely new solutions to big challenges. In addition to this, there is a need for the UK to consider further the question of how AI interacts with people, and what it means to create effective human-AI partnerships. One such moonshot, directly relevant to AI, might involve a major challenge aimed at developing and establishing appropriate methods for safe, ethical, explainable and reproducible AI which will accelerate its use across many sectors. Another would be the development of an innovation ecosystem enabled by the UK Digital Twin programme, as discussed later in this RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION 13 Roadmap, within which AI would use these virtual worlds to explore real world optimisations that are beyond human scale. AI should also be built into moonshots in other sectors where it could play a major part, for example to radically accelerate materials science to develop new materials that can better store energy from renewable sources, or in solving for real-time control of the increasingly complex electricity distribution network as the country moves towards net zero emissions. Across all the potential types of challenge- based funding, programmes need to be selected and designed to draw in and accelerate AIÕs integration across disciplines and sectors. One suggestion would be to select broad sectors that are more mature, and thus ripe for AI adoption than others, and use the mission-based approach to focus minds. This would bring together basic and applied research and multiple disciplines across research horizons and opportunities for systems development, helping to mature AI as a discipline. The specific vehicle for delivering moonshots is a ripe topic for discussion, but a forward-looking framework for research, development and innovation consisting of a series of labs, which conceive of and build fully engineered prototypes and platforms, could offer a flexible model of experimentation. These labs could generate vision-based
