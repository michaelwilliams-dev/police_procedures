victim interactions and improved report accuracy.35 By equipping officers to handle cases sensitively, the policy seeks to reduce victim-blaming and encourage survivors to report abuse. Additionally, implementation will begin with pilot programs in urban and rural areas, allowing for iterative improvements before scaling nationwide. Beyond skill-building, the policy includes sustained engagement with local religious and community leaders to address cultural resistance, particularly in rural areas where family unity is often prioritized over victim safety.36 Recent initiatives provide a model for success: in August 2023, the UNDP and the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted field training as part of the SDG Partnership to address gender-based violence.37 Expanding this training nationally through a continuous program is essential to ensure lasting change. In essence, by establishing these practices as standard within law enforcement training, this policy would foster a sustainable, systemic response to gender-based violence across Kyrgyzstan, embedding trauma-informed, community- centered practices within the countryâs policing framework.38, 39 Moving beyond temporary solutions, it aims to transform domestic violence response into lasting protection for survivors.
