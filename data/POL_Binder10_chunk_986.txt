NON-DISCLOSURE Wiltshire Police officers and staff must be aware of the risk to their integrity that unmanageable debt/borrowing brings and this can therefore impact on public trust in the organisation. It is therefore important for our employees to know that a failure to disclose to the Force could have a significant impact on them. By definition, this could have a detrimental effect on an individualÕs security clearance or even continued suitability for employment. In all cases, where there is evidence that an individual has wilfully failed or neglected to discharge lawful debt / borrowing, consideration will be given as to whether any misconduct proceedings are appropriate. 7.
