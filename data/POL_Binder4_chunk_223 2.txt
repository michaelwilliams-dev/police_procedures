Hearsay evidence in detention order proceedings Evidence must not be excluded in detention order proceedings on the ground that it is hearsay (of whatever degree). Articles 4 and 5 of the Civil Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 apply in relation to detention order proceedings as those articles apply in relation to civil proceedings. Detention order proceedings are proceedingsâ for an order under section 195M; for the discharge or variation of such an order; on an appeal under section 195O. Hearsay is a statement which is made otherwise than by a person while giving oral evidence in the proceedings and which is tendered as evidence of the matters stated. Nothing in this section affects the admissibility of evidence which is admissible apart from this section. 195R Release of property This section applies in relation to property whichâ has been seized by an appropriate officer under section 195C, and is detained under or by virtue of any of sections 195J to 195M and 195P. The property must be released if at any time an appropriate officer decides that the detention condition is no longer met. The detention condition is met for so long asâ any of the conditions in section 195B is met, and there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion mentioned in section 195C(1). Nothing in this section requires property to be released if there is a power to detain it otherwise than under or by virtue of sections 195J to 195M and 195P. Nothing in this section affects the operation of any power or duty to release property that arises apart from this section.
