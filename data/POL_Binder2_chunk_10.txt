Nothing in Code G reduces the significance of a suspectÕs interview as forming part of a prompt and effective investigation; the necessity to arrest to conduct the interview is a separate issue that could be influenced by a number of factors according to the circumstances of each individual case. Each case must be considered on the circumstances as they exist to the officer at the time and be decided on a case by case basis using professional judgement and discretion 2 PACE, Code G Note for Guidance 2F. concerning necessity and proportionality. The importance of documenting the decision making process for future scrutiny if necessary should not be under estimated. On many occasions a voluntary interview or an alternative course of action to arrest will be the most appropriate course of action, particularly when dealing with minor offences where the actions of the suspect if at liberty cannot influence the outcome of other enquiries. Officers considering the necessity to arrest to conduct a prompt and effective investigation from an interview perspective should consider the following which is not an exhaustive list:  It is thought unlikely that the person would attend the police station voluntarily to be interviewed;  It is necessary to interview the suspect about the outcome of other investigative action for which their arrest is necessary;  Arrest would enable the anticipated delivery of special warnings which can only be given to persons under arrest and, therefore, cannot be used in a voluntary interview;  The person has made false statements and/or presented false evidence;  It is thought likely the person may steal or destroy evidence, collude or make contact with co-suspects or conspirators or may intimidate or threaten to make contact with witnesses;  The complexity of the interview strategy, such as whether it involves only a single issue requiring interview (e.g. the lawful use of self defence), or whether other investigative activity which could be influenced by the suspect if not in custody is to be conducted, e.g. checking alibis, comparing accounts with other material, and gathering supporting evidence of the provable lie for future challenge;   Whether it is necessary to detain the suspect at the police station to conduct other enquiries either during or following the interview, e.g. checking alibis, comparing accounts with other material, and gathering supporting evidence for further interview;  The likely length of the detention period required to conduct such interviews and enquiries (including whether this is likely to be over 24 hours for indictable offences);  Effective management of the interview process for multiple suspects without allowing them the opportunity to collude;  The impact of the pre-interview disclosure briefing (PIB) to a legal representative and any tactics to be used such as phased or staged disclosure necessitating a series of interviews;  Whether the suspect is already on bail for other offences which may trigger the necessity to arrest to prevent further offences or minimise the risk of harm to others;  What considerations are
