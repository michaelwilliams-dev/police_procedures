imitation revolvers must conform to the specifications set out in regulations 4 and 6 of the 2011 Regulations respectively. Under regulation 7 of the 2011 Regulations, the offence in section 39(2)(d) of the 2006 Act of importing an imitation firearm which does not conform to the specifications does not apply where the imitation firearm was imported for one of the reasons specified in section 37(2) of the 2006 Act (see paragraph 2.39). Small firearms 2.46 Section 5 of the 1968 Act prohibits any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30cm in length or is less than 60cm in length overall, other than an air weapon, a muzzle-loading gun or a firearm designed as signalling apparatus. The intention was to prohibit certain particularly dangerous firearms which were easy to conceal. In general terms, this has meant the prohibition of handguns but it is important to remember that the legislation does not refer explicitly to handguns; instead it refers to small firearms. For exemptions to the requirement to obtain the Secretary of StateÕs authority to possess prohibited firearms see Chapter 3. Antiques 2.47 Apart from sections 19, 20 and 21, Schedule 3, and any other provision of the 1968 Act so far as it applies in relation to an offence under the aforementioned sections, the provisions of the 1968 Act do not apply to antique firearms kept as curiosities or ornaments (section 58(2) of the 1968 Act refers) (see chapters 5 and 8). The Antique Firearms Regulations 2021 specify which firearms can be regarded as antique, and further details are set out in Chapter 8.

An air rifle with a muzzle energy in excess of 12 foot-pounds must be held on a firearm certificate.
