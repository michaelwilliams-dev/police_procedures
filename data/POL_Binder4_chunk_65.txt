to omit the mandate of seniority-based layoffs within the upcoming legislative session. This legislative change will limit the immediate disproportionate quantity of post- ESSER layoffs on newer educators. To convince lawmakers to reform the statutes, advocates can develop and present case studies based on the successes of any of the 20 states which restrict âlast-in. first-outâ policies.10 To best serve teachers and students alike, New York should pursue a more standardized approach. Prior to making any additional statutory change, the New York State Department of Education (NYSED) must analyze which aspects of teaching most accurately predict student outcomes. NYSED should launch a series of Randomly-Controlled Trials (RCTs) in schools across the state to analyze various factors of teacher performance, including short-term academic teacher value- added measures and teacher absenteeism. The exhaustive list of teacher effectiveness measures should be developed by a legislative task force composed of advocates for the aforementioned bill, with the input of teacher unions (to ensure fairness) and advocacy groups. Over the course of the next two years, NYSED should measure engagement-based student outcomes such as changes in student-reported self-efficacy to thoroughly measure how different teacher factors affect studentsâ willingness to learn. Following the data collection and analysis of this statewide study, NYSED or a separate legislative task force can determine impacts of specific agreed-upon teacher factors on student engagement outcomes. Legislators should pass an additional bill modifying New York Education Law articles 2510 and 2588 to prioritize factors with the strongest empirical proof in layoff situations, and districts should recommend these factors as ongoing accountability measures.
