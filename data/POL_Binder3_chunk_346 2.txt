and post-implementation. Additionally, the retention rates within classes and majors should be used to determine if culturally responsive teaching effectively encourages students through engagement and participation. Adding these techniques into daily lessons will make individuals more empathetic and culturally informed inside and outside of the classroom. Policy Analysis Culturally responsive teaching has proven to improve academic outcomes and the development of ethnic-racial identity due to culturally responsive teaching being more effective than traditional teaching methods.10 Although teachers feel ill-prepared to lead conversations about race, a University of Pittsburgh study revealed that they would be willing to implement culturally responsive teaching in their classrooms if they received adequate training.11 Furthermore, the ease of implementing culturally responsive teaching through simple curriculum changes, such as changing the literature being studied, makes universities more inclined to implement the program. The primary issue with traditional learning is that it does not address the realities of todayÕs society and only supports a certain demographic: middle-class, white, and English-speaking families.13 A simple solution is increasing diversity among teachers. Since 80% of full-time professors are white, conversations about race become easier when students of color feel connected to their teachers because of shared experiences.13 It has been noted that students are, in fact, not the blank slates they are made out to be; they start to develop their own understandings of the world very early on, and it is key to utilize this within classrooms rather than repress it.14 To counter the argument of the Republican lawmakers who do not find it beneficial to the economy to invest in DEI initiatives, research shows a correlation between attending a racially diverse institution and income earnings.5 Therefore, implementing culturally responsive teaching can counter the anti-DEI legislation and assist the future economy. The qualitative measure of student participation increases active learning, therefore enhancing problem-solving and collaboration between students. Since DEI policies create equitable resources for all students and foster a sense of community where everyone feels valued, it is vital to create substitute programs amidst the recent legislation targeting DEI practices. Highlights  The increasing attacks on efforts to ensure minorities have an equal playing field makes culturally responsive teaching essential for creating an immediate impact.  Over 100 bills in 30 states are working to limit or ban DEI policies such as DEI training, DEI offices and staff, diversity statements, and identity-based preferences for hiring and admissions within higher education.2  To counter anti-DEI legislation, culturally responsive teaching can be implemented to ensure equity remains at the forefront of education.  Culturally responsive teaching fosters a more inclusive classroom by creating a space where individuals can learn from each otherÕs backgrounds, become more informed, and therefore increase collaboration and problem- solving skills.8 Implementation Implementing culturally responsive teaching is simple and has significant benefits. This teaching increases face-to-face communication, open dialogue, and integration of current world issues to better understand studentsÕ backgrounds into the curriculum.9 Therefore, culturally responsive teaching can work to create the same environment DEI policies promote by making
