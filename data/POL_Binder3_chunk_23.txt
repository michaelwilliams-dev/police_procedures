according to Afrobarometer, more than half of those surveyed in Limpopo said that Òmost or all police are corruptÓ; in 2015 that figure had nearly halved (28 per cent). The study found that police-related bribery reduction in Limpopo occurred at the same time that the national government led an unprecedented high-level anti-corruption intervention in several provinces (Peiffer et al. 2018). The research suggests the police in Limpopo may have been especially reluctant to engage in bribery during this time because of an uncertainty as to whether they were also under investigation for corruption and because of the heightened anti- corruption action that took place. The drivers of bribery reduction in this case were likely indirect and unanticipated, a Òbenign side effectÓ of a separate anti-corruption intervention. The intervention in Limpopo was not targeted at local police, yet police likely feared they were under greater scrutiny as part of the perceived efficient degree of Òcommand and controlÓ national-level agents were exerting. The sustainability of the interventionÕs impact on bribery reduction in Limpopo is therefore questionable (Peiffer et al. 2018). This case demonstrates that certain types of disruption may work to reduce bribery patterns, but only in a relatively short timeframe. For longer impact, disruption strategies likely need to be continuously inventive and re-inventive, and driven by strong leadership (Peiffer et al. 2018). 3. Lessons learned Several analysts warn that there is no single anti- corruption strategy that has been sufficient to fully address police corruption (Newburn 1999). Such a complex problem needs a similarly multi-faceted solution, and second, no absolute solution is likely to be possible, although a huge reduction in the quantity of cases is. Several caveats must be borne in mind in any discussion of police corruption. Firstly, the fluid nature of corruption makes it unpredictable and far from universal: some police departments are capable of operating for long stretches of time with relatively little scandal. Secondly, the exposure of police corruption, while frequently necessary to urge reform, can have the undesirable effect of destroying the morale of the police force as a whole: although this is a far lesser problem than the continuation of corruption. Thirdly, while the motivations behind corruption might be similar in vastly different environments, local traditions and structures mean that effective reforms need to be tailored to the targeted locations (Transparency International 2012). Several best practices emerge from the literature and case studies explored above. As a general rule, for anti-corruption strategies to be successful and comprehensive they need to be embedded in the broader framework of democratic institution- building (Chne 2010). Social, economic and political context Police reform clearly needs to be grounded in the political and social realities of the country and the characteristics of the local police (Chne 2010) rather than adopting a Òone size fits allÓ approach. While some aspects of police corruption and misconduct appear to be universal, others are unique to Ð or at least more salient in Ð some contexts and cultures (DCAF 2012). As Quah (2017)
