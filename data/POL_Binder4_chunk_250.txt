be returned to the territory to serve the sentence. A person who is to be returned to a territory by virtue of an undertaking given under subsection (2) must be returned as soon as is reasonably practicable after the sentence is imposed and any other proceedings in respect of the offence are concluded. If subsection (4) is complied with the sentence for the offence is treated as served but the person's conviction for the offence must be treated as a conviction for all other purposes. The sentence for the offence is treated as served under subsection (5) only in so far as it consists of the sentence of imprisonment or another form of detention mentioned in subsection (3). Subsection (8) applies ifâ subsection (4) is not complied with, and the person applies to the court which imposed the sentence to expedite return to the territory. The court must order return by such date as is specified in the order unless reasonable cause is shown for the delay. If a person is to be returned by virtue of an undertaking given under subsection (2), a constable mayâ remove the person from any prison or other institution where the person is detained; keep the person in custody until returned; convey the person to the territory to which the person is to be returned. 153D Sections 153A and 153C etc: supplementary Nothing in section 153A or 153C requires the return of a person to a territory in a case in which the Secretary of State is not satisfied that the return is compatible with the Convention rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998 or with the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.
