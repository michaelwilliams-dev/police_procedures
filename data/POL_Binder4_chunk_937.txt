A Womenâs Aid survey of 134 domestic abuse service organisations suggests that older victims are not being seen by specialist support services in the numbers that we would expect and can face significant barriers when asking for help or when trying to leave a relationship with a perpetrator.100 Barriers can include that victims: have experienced years of prolonged abuse; are isolated within a particular community through language or culture; have experienced long term health impacts or disabilities; or are reliant on the perpetrator for their care or money.

Particularly, that he would become more isolated and dependent on his wife as he developed care needs and was no longer able to leave his home without support. He wanted to be able to spend time with his adult children, who were discouraged from visiting by his wife. David had become increasingly depressed and wanted to leave his wife but he didnât know how to access support. The social worker recognised that David was experiencing domestic abuse and explained that she felt he would benefit from support from a specialist service for older victims of abuse.
