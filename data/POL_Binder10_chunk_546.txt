A police constable exercises the powers and privileges of a constable improperly if they exercise (or fail to exercise) a power or privilege for the purpose of achieving a benefit for themselves, or a benefit or a detriment for another person. Under the Bribery Act 2010 it is an offence to accept a gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing or not doing anything in your official capacity; or showing favour (or disfavour) to anyone in your official capacity. Any money, gift or consideration including hospitality, received from any person or organisation holding or seeking to obtain a contract with the Police may be deemed by the courts to have been received corruptly unless proved otherwise. The offences can be summarised as don't offer a bribe, don't accept a bribe and don't bribe a foreign official. A corporate body can also be liable but may utilise a defence that they had "adequate procedures" in place to prevent bribery. The Bribery Act does not prohibit reasonable and proportionate hospitality and promotional or other similar business expenditure, intended to improve the image of a commercial organisation, to better/present products or services, or to establish cordial relations.
