The Attorney General must make a Code of Practice under that section as to: (a) the exercise by the relevant Directors of functions they have under Chapter 2 of Part 8 of POCA; and (b) the exercise by any other person, who is the relevant authority by virtue of section 357(9) of POCA in relation to a confiscation investigation, of functions that person has under Chapter 2 of Part 8 of POCA in relation to England, Wales and Northern Ireland as the relevant authority. (a) 2. What that means is that this Code provides guidance as to how, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the relevant Directors are to use the Part 8 investigatory powers in their role as appropriate officers in civil recovery investigations1, how the relevant Directors are to use their powers to obtain a disclosure order in a civil recovery or a confiscation investigation2, how a person specified by the Secretary of State as a prosecutor under section 357(9) is to use the power to obtain a disclosure order in a confiscation investigation3, and how the relevant Directors use their powers to request assistance in connection with a civil recovery investigation, a detained cash investigation or an exploitation proceeds investigation, in relation to evidence which is overseas4. The powers of investigation are not available for a civil recovery investigation if an interim receiving order or administration order is extant against the relevant property; proceedings for a civil recovery order have been started against the relevant property; or cash is detained under section 295 of POCA5, although they do remain available if a property freezing order has been obtained, but proceedings for a civil recovery order have not started. 3.
