to the community and which MoPI Group (1 to 4) should be assigned. They will also provide support to the Records Manager by responding to records management enquiries, providing advice and guidance and escalating to the Records Manager where appropriate. Audit Trails Audit trails will be provided for all records and documents. They should be kept securely and should be available for inspection by authorised personnel. Audit trails will be managed since they may be of critical importance to the organisation. Claims of compliance may be discredited if the audit trail is not treated correctly and cannot be interpreted unambiguously. The audit trail will include a record of all relevant occurrences and will be secure. If any significant occurrence is not audited, then the whole audit trail can be discredited and as a direct result all or any information held within the system will also be able to be discredited. For all audit trail data, it will be possible to identify the processes, enabling technology and individuals involved and the time and date of the event. POLICY AIM To competently record and manage all information held for policing activity in an efficient and consistent manner to support the objectives and vision of Wiltshire Police and the OPCC and ensure that national and local objectives are met. LEGAL BASIS AND DRIVING FORCE Key drivers for this policy and the need for a consistent approach are legislative, particularly the eight principles of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the College of Policing (COP) Authorised Professional Practice (APP) on Information Management. A failure to record, retain, review and dispose information appropriately may constitute a breach and, ultimately, undermine public confidence in the Force.
