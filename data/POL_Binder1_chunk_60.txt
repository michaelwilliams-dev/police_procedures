Female Genital Mutilation Act 200320 (Òthe 2003 ActÓ). 20 Parts of the 2003 Act also apply in Northern Ireland.

Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 Under section 1(1) of the 2003 Act, a person is guilty of an offence if they excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the whole or any part of a girlÕs labia majora, labia minora or clitoris. Section 6(1) of the 2003 Act provides that the term ÒgirlÓ includes ÒwomanÓ so the offences in sections 1 to 3 apply to victims of any age.
