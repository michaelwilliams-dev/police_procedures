are unusual delays with the postal system, authorities should make allowances for late payments made by post when considering whether a payment was received within the statutory period. Enforcing authorities may wish to keep the envelope that the payments came in, as the franking can be used as evidence of the date of posting. 11L.3 A fixed penalty notice is deemed ÔpaidÕ as soon as it is received by the enforcing authority. The enforcing authority should promptly close the case. An authorityÕs systems should accurately record the day on which it receives payments so that no further enforcement action is taken. 11L.4 If a fixed penalty notice is issued in lieu of prosecution, recipients must be given 14 days to pay before any prosecution proceedings can be brought. 11L.5 Recipients of civil penalty notices have 28 days from the date of receipt in which to make the payment, otherwise the penalty will double. If a civil penalty notice is issued by first-class post, it is deemed to have been received on the second working day after posting (or the fifth working day, if sent to an address outside the UK). 11L.6 To encourage prompt payment, enforcing authorities may offer recipients a reduction in the penalty if paid before this deadline. The period during which a discount for early payment is offered must be no more than 14 days and to avoid confusion, it is recommended that it should not be more than 10 days. The minimum discounted penalty is set out in the relevant legislation: 13 Section 88(3) EPA 1990. 14 Payment Service Regulations 2017 Offence Default penalty Minimum full penalty Maximum full penalty Minimum discounted penalty Littering £100 £65 £500 £50 Graffiti £100 £65 £500 £50 Fly-posting £100 £65 £500 £50 Unauthorised distribution of free literature on designated land £100 £65 £150 £50 Nuisance parking £100 £100 £100 £60 Abandoning a vehicle £200 £200 £200 £120 Fly-tipping £200 £150 £1000 £120 Household waste duty of care £200 £150 £600 £120 Failure to produce a waste transfer note £300 £300 £300 £180 Industrial and commercial waste receptacle offences £100 £75 £110 £60 Failing to show waste documents £200 £150 £400 £120 11L.7 Discounts for early payment may also be offered for civil penalty notices: Contravention Default penalty Minimum full penalty Maximum full penalty Minimum discounted penalty Littering from a £100 Equivalent to local fixed £50 vehicle penalty for littering offences £65 - £500 Domestic waste £60 £60 £80 £40 receptacle offences 11L.8 Enforcing authorities may choose to send recipients of penalty notices a reminder letter. Again, it is recommended that these are sent out no earlier than 7 days from the date the penalty was issued. The reminder letters should inform the recipient of the following: a. how much they must pay b. when they must pay by c. what happens if they donÕt pay d. how they can make representations (civil penalties) or dispute their liability for the offence to which the penalty relates (penalties in lieu of prosecution)
