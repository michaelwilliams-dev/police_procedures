opted in to the Internal Security Fund measure pre-adoption; no decision has been taken by the Government on whether to do so post-adoption. The "Pericles" programme 3. The second of the draft decisions to which section 82 applies relates to the ÒPericles" programme. The Pericles programme was established in 2001 to protect the Euro against counterfeiting. The programme Ð which initially operated for the period 2002 to 2006 - provided for specialised, multidisciplinary training to tackle counterfeiting of the euro and for the exchange of personnel involved in protecting the euro, such as financial staff, police officers and lawyers. The Pericles programme applied not only to Member States participating in the single currency, but was extended to those Member States Ð including the United Kingdom - which had not 1 http://www.biicl.org/files/4276_decision_2007-124- ec_est_spec_prog_on_prevention,_preparedness_and_consequence_mgmt_of_terrorism.pdf 2 http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2015187%202013%20INIT adopted the euro given the common interest in protecting a major currency against counterfeiting. 4. Pericles was first renewed in 2006 and ran from 1 January 2007 until 31 December 2013. The European Commission concluded that the Pericles programme should be renewed again and the renewed programme (ÒPericles 2020Ó) runs from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. The legal basis for the renewed programme is Article 133 of the TFEU which relates to the single currency. It is again proposed to extend this renewed programme to those Member States which had not adopted the euro. That will be done by way of a measure (document number 16616/13)3 the legal basis for which is Article 352 of the TFEU. By continuing to support the Pericles programme, the UK will benefit directly from the training and information exchange provided under the programme to help combat counterfeiting by organised crime groups.

In 2012 the Office of the ChildrenÕs Commissioner for England recommended that Ôa review of all legislation and guidance which makes reference to children as ÒprostitutesÓ or involved in prostitution should be initiated by the Government with the view to amending the wording to acknowledge children as sexually exploited, and where appropriate victimised through commercial sexual exploitationÕ. Concerns about the continued use of this terminology were reiterated to a cross party inquiry into child sexual exploitation chaired by Sarah Champion MP in April 2014, including its impact on attitudes towards victims and reinforcing misconceptions. A report, Real Voices, by Ann Coffey MP, published in October 2014, similarly recommended removing the term child prostitution from legislation. 2. The Government supports the principle behind the removal of statutory references to child prostitution and section 67 of the Serious Crime Act makes the necessary amendments to the Sexual Offence Act 2003 (Òthe 2003 ActÓ) and other primary legislation to this end. 3. The terms child prostitution and child pornography are referred to in the titles of sections 48 (causing or inciting child prostitution or pornography), 49 (controlling a child prostitute or a child
