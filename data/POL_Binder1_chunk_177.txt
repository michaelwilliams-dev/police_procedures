The Serious Crime Act 2015 (ããthe 2015 Act??) received Royal Assent on 3 March. The 2015 Act gives effect to a number of legislative proposals set out in the Serious and Organised Crime Strategy published in October 2013 and, in doing so, will ensure that the National Crime Agency, the police and other law enforcement agencies have the powers they need to pursue, disrupt and bring to justice those engaged in serious and organised crime. The 2015 Act also introduces measures to enhance the protection of vulnerable children and others, including by strengthening the law to tackle female genital mutilation (ÒFGMÓ) and domestic abuse. In addition, the 2015 Act includes provisions to tighten prison security and to guard against the threat of terrorism. 2. The 2015 Act itself provides for a small number of its provisions to come into force either on the day of Royal Assent or two months afterwards (that is, on 3 May). In addition, the Minister for Modern Slavery and Organised Crime has now made the first commencement regulations (the Serious Crime Act 2015 (Commencement No. 1) Regulations 2015) bringing other provisions of the Act into force on either 3 May or 1 June. This circular provides details of those provisions of the 2015 Act that are coming into force on or before 1 June. It will be supported by more detailed operational guidance to the police and others issued by, amongst others, the College of Policing. 3. A glossary of abbreviations used in this circular is contained in Annex A. 4. A point of contact for each of the provisions in this circular can be found in Annex B. 1. Sections 1-12, 14: Sections 37, 39: Section 40: 5. Sections 1-12, 14, 37 and 39 make amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (ÒPOCAÓ). Section 40 amends section 97 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which makes provision for confiscation orders to be made in magistrates? courts. These provisions, which come into force on 1 June, will be detailed in a subsequent Home Office circular to be issued in May. That circular will also cover other
