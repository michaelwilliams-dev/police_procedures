and agri-tech leaders like John Deere, as well as large agricultural ventures in the Southwest, including groups like Driscollâs Farms that specialize in water conservation.4,5 The program would allocate funding to businesses developing water- efficient irrigation systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, and advanced soil health monitoring technologies, supporting the development and implementation of innovative water-saving and crop- enhancing technologies. States can initiate pilot programs and demonstration projects that showcase the potential of agricultural technologies in real- world settings. Policy Analysis Specific technologies show potential in the Southwest. Solutions like N-Dripâs gravity- powered drip irrigation system help farmers conserve water by replacing the outdated flood irrigation method still used in nearly 40% of the regionâs farms.6 This system can reduce water use by up to 70% without requiring pumps or energy, which is particularly suited to areas like California and Arizona where water scarcity is a more pressing issue.6 Digital tools, such as Acuity Agriculture's dashboard, provide farmers with real-time data on soil moisture and climate conditions to help them optimize irrigation practices and meet strict water usage regulations. Additionally, indoor and vertical farming technologies, which use recycled water and AI-controlled systems, have emerged as key innovations for growing crops with up to 95% less water, helping reduce issues with the regionâs water supply draining. Together, these technologies are essential for adapting to the Southwestâs rapidly changing water landscape, which is driven by both population growth and climate change. The USDA and Congress could maximize the effectiveness of these technologies through SAIRPâs joint loan program by providing essential funding for initial implementation and scaling. By backing innovations like N-Dripâs energy-free irrigation and Acuity Agricultureâs data-driven soil monitoring, SAIRP helps farmers transition from outdated methods without bearing high upfront costs. Additionally, USDA-led coordination ensures farmers have access to training and technical support, minimizing barriers to adoption. While initial costs are high, the long-term savings in water and increased crop yields can offset these expenses, investing in a sustainable solution for both the government and farmers. Highlights Increasing droughts and wildfires threaten water resources in the Southwestern United States, highlighting the need for sustainable agricultural practices and new technologies to protect water availability.1 Agriculture uses roughly 70% of global freshwater.1 The Southwestâs reliance on limited water sources and vulnerable watersheds calls for innovative resource management and conservation. The Southwest Agricultural Innovation and Resilience Program (SAIRP) would provide $5 billion in federal loans and grants through the USDA, targeting irrigation, drought-resistant crops, and digital monitoring technologies.4,5 With federal support, technologies like N-Drip irrigation and AI soil monitoring can reduce water use by up to 70%, improve crop yields, and adapt farming practices to the regionâs evolving climate challenges.6 Implementation To implement SAIRP once approved, Congress and the USDA could model the initiative on existing green energy acts, such as the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP - H.R. 5051), which provides grants and loan guarantees to agricultural producers and rural businesses for energy- efficient projects.7 Similar to REAP, SAIRP could offer grants and subsidized loans
