[1] Securing Financial Futures: A Proposal for Financial Literacy Education By Ben Nusbaum, bbn24@cornell.edu Students lack necessary financial skills to make smart life decisions. Therefore, New York should implement a financial literacy course that covers budgeting, investing, and other personal financial skills into the 12th-grade curriculum. Background The role of education is to provide students with the knowledge and skills to navigate life and become productive members of society. One skill crucial to becoming a successful adult and leading a happy, fulfilling life is financial literacy. Financial literacy is the ability to understand and use financial skills, such as budgeting, investing, understanding taxes and saving for retirement.1 However, over half of teens report feeling unready to handle their finances.2 A 2019 survey of 30,000 college students found 47% do not feel prepared to manage their money, with only 37% of Gen Z students planning to follow a budget and 47% planning to pay off their credit card on time.3 It is clear that students donÕt feel financially prepared for their futures. However, public schools have the ability to bridge this gap, and it is important they take all measures to educate and prepare their students. More than half of states require high school students to take a semester-long financial literacy course before graduating.4 However, New York lags behind, only requiring an economics course, which is also its own graduation requirement.5,6 New York State (NYS) high school economics courses focus on large-scale market concepts, not practical financial skills students can use in everyday life. The course recommended in New York has four main standards, and only one of the standards, ÒIndividual Responsibility and the Economy,Ó has sub-standards on personal finance.7 Within New York, only 20 high schools, about 1.3% of those in the state, require a semester-long personal finance course to graduate.8,9 Evidently, American students lack the financial literacy necessary for long-term success as adults, and NYS must do its part to improve its insufficient financial curriculum. Policy Idea Education should prepare students for life after graduation; therefore, schools must teach financial literacy skills that will be crucial to student well-being in life, regardless of the path they take after graduation. The NYS Legislature should create a graduation requirement that all high schoolers must complete a semester-long financial literacy course. This course will be taken in 12th grade and will teach students the fundamentals of financial literacy, including personal financial knowledge, investment skills, and basic
