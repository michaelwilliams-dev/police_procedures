The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has been specified as a prosecutor for the purposes of section 357(8)(b) (a confiscation investigation carried out by an AFI). 4 See section 375A. 5 See section 341(3). 5. This Code includes a section on general provisions relating to all orders and warrants (paragraphs 17 to 54) followed by detailed sections on each of the following topics:  Production orders (paragraphs 55 to 73);  Search and seizure warrants (paragraphs 74 to 121);  Customer information orders (paragraphs 122 to 131);  Account monitoring orders (paragraphs 132 to 142);  Disclosure orders (paragraphs 143 to 243); and  Obtaining evidence from abroad (paragraphs 244 to 251). 6.
